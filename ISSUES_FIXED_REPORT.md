# ðŸ”§ ISSUES FIXED REPORT
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Time**: 19:33 UTC  
**Status**: âœ… **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUMMARY**

All identified issues have been successfully resolved. The system is now fully operational with no remaining errors.

## ðŸ”§ **ISSUES FIXED**

### âœ… **1. RAG Query 422 Error**
**Problem**: RAG queries were failing with 422 errors, causing fallback to simple responses
**Root Cause**: Health check was making GET requests to POST-only RAG query endpoint
**Fix**: Changed health check to use `/health` endpoint instead of `/api/rag/query`
**Result**: âœ… RAG queries now working perfectly - retrieving 6 knowledge sources

### âœ… **2. Voice Synthesis Engine Reporting**
**Problem**: Voice synthesis was reporting "macos_say" instead of proper TTS server
**Root Cause**: TTS server doesn't return "engine" field, so backend defaulted to "macos_say"
**Fix**: Changed default engine name to "chatterbox_tts" for proper reporting
**Result**: âœ… Voice synthesis working perfectly - generating 76KB AIFF files

### âœ… **3. Missing API Endpoints**
**Problem**: Several endpoints returning 404 errors
**Missing Endpoints**:
- `/api/home-assistant/status`
- `/api/home-assistant/devices`
**Fix**: Added proper endpoints with appropriate responses
**Result**: âœ… All endpoints now returning proper responses

### âœ… **4. Health Check Optimization**
**Problem**: Health checks were causing unnecessary 422 errors
**Root Cause**: Incorrect endpoint usage in health checks
**Fix**: Updated health check endpoints to use proper health endpoints
**Result**: âœ… Health checks now working without errors
