## 🔧 Technical Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Agent Selection Logic**
```python
# Improved keyword matching with expanded vocabulary
task_keywords = {
    "code_generation": ["write", "create", "implement", "function", "class", "code", "program", "python", "javascript", "java", "c++", "algorithm", "script", "api", "develop", "build", "construct"],
    "debugging": ["debug", "fix", "error", "bug", "issue", "problem", "broken", "not working", "exception", "traceback", "syntax error", "troubleshoot", "resolve"],
    "analysis": ["analyze", "analysis", "examine", "evaluate", "assess", "review", "study", "investigate", "compare", "contrast", "breakdown", "interpret", "understand"],
    "reasoning_deep": ["explain", "how does", "why", "complex", "detailed", "comprehensive", "thorough", "deep dive", "in-depth", "philosophical", "theoretical", "reasoning", "logic", "deduce", "infer"],
    "quicktake": ["quick", "brief", "summary", "overview", "short", "concise", "tl;dr", "in a nutshell", "key points", "main points", "fast", "rapid"],
    "strategic_planning": ["plan", "strategy", "roadmap", "approach", "methodology", "framework", "architecture", "design", "blueprint", "organize", "structure", "coordinate"]
}
```

### 2. **Robust Model Fallback System**
```python
# Comprehensive fallback handling
if model_key not in self.models:
    logger.warning(f"Model {model_key} not found, attempting fallback")
    fallback_models = ['primary', 'lightweight', 'mlx_qwen3_30b', 'mlx_dia_1_6b']
    for fallback in fallback_models:
        if fallback in self.models:
            logger.info(f"Using fallback model: {fallback}")
            model_key = fallback
            break
```

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
```python
# Timeout protection for parallel reasoning
try:
    parallel_result = await asyncio.wait_for(
        self.parallel_engine.parallel_reasoning(...),
        timeout=30.0  # 30 second timeout
    )
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    logger.warning("Parallel reasoning timed out, falling back to standard selection")
```

### 4. **Monitoring Integration**
```python
# Added missing agent_profiles property
self.agent_profiles = self.agent_registry._profiles
```
