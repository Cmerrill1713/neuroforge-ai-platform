  "description": "The Claude Code team just STEALTH LAUNCHED Plan Mode, and it's about to change how you approach Spec based AI coding.\n\nüé• FEATURED RESOURCES:\n\n- Infinite Agentic Loop Codebase: https://github.com/disler/infinite-agentic-loop\n\n- Infinite Agentic Loop Video: https://youtu.be/9ipM_vDwflI_a\n\n- Principled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=7LWl3EbcFTc\n\n- Claude Code: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\n\nThe debate is OVER. Claude Code is demolishing the competition with their most cracked engineering team in AI. While other tools add complexity, Claude Code delivers with a game-changing principle: \"do the simple thing first.\" Plan Mode isn't just another feature - it's a paradigm shift that mirrors how senior engineers actually work.\n\nüöÄ In this video, indydevdan breaks down Claude Code's new Plan Mode - a simple yet powerful feature that forces you to think like a senior engineer: understand first, plan second, build third. No more cowboy coding with AI agents. This is about loading your context window with the RIGHT information before making a single file modification.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Discover TWO powerful ways to leverage Plan Mode:\n1. Plan ‚Üí Execute (for quick tasks with Shift+Tab twice)\n2. Plan ‚Üí Write Spec ‚Üí Execute (for mid to large features)\n\nüí° Watch as we transform our Infinite Agentic Loop codebase using principled AI coding techniques. See Plan Mode in action as we upgrade from single HTML files to modular CSS, JS, and HTML architectures - all planned and executed with surgical precision using Claude 4 Opus.\n\nüî• Key breakthroughs you'll master:\n‚Ä¢ Meta-prompting techniques that write prompts for you\n‚Ä¢ Higher-order prompt patterns for maximum agentic coding leverage  \n‚Ä¢ The principle that \"the plan IS the prompt\" - a game-changer for AI coding\n‚Ä¢ How to prime your agents with context before unleashing them on your codebase\n‚Ä¢ Why planning mode converges on senior engineer workflows\n\n‚ö° This isn't just about Claude Code - it's about fundamentally shifting how you approach agentic coding. The winning engineers are setting up their codebases not for themselves, but for their AI agents. Watch as we fire up parallel Claude Code agents, each working on isolated tasks based on our meticulously crafted plans. This is the future of software engineering, and it's happening RIGHT NOW.\n\nStay focused and keep building. üí™\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 The most cracked engineering team\n00:57 Claude Code Plan Mode\n04:09 Engineering With Plan Mode\n14:58 Fire Infinite Agentic Loop V4\n\n#claudecode #agenticcoding #aicoding",
