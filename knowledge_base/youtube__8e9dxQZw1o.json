Let me know if you have any ideas, thoughts or questions in the comments.\n\nFrom May 1st to June 1st 2022 I set out to build an ENTIRE app within 30 days. Can I do it? Let's see.\n\nüìï My story\n\nHey coders. I'm Dan Isler, an indie developer from Murderapolis, Minnesota.\n\nI've been coding for 10+ years now and after grinding out code for tech companies I decided I wanted to prove to myself that I could build valuable software on my own terms. I quickly learned coding is only a third of the story. I'm learning to put together the remaining pieces in order to become a true indie developer. \n\nOn this channel I share my journey with you to connect, share, entertain and to teach but ultimately, to help you accelerate your own journey. \n\n\nFollow along the journey. Together we will create, build, make mistakes, learn and iterate.\n\nIn success or failure - I'll see you in the next one!\n\nüíª¬†Software\n\n- Vue3 (setup) https://vuejs.org/\n- Typescript https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n- Electronjs https://www.electronjs.org/\n- Pinia https://pinia.vuejs.org/\n- Vite https://vitejs.dev/\n- SASS https://sass-lang.com/\n- Github copilot https://copilot.github.com/\n- Electron + vite + vue template: https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder\n\nüñ•¬†Equipment\n\n- Mac book pro 16\" 2019 https://support.apple.com/kb/SP809?locale=en_US\n- Dell U-Series 38\" U3818DW https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-monitor-u4919dw/apd/210-arnw/monitors-monitor-accessories?gacd=9646510-1028-5761040-266706306-0&dgc=st&ds_k=DYNAMIC+SEARCH+ADS&ds_rl=1282789&gclid=CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl31qIZ4D8ut1OWPvNviY3UE77Poi2-wfi7uM-PY3ucNYCo7Gu7GF63RoCoaUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&nclid=d5WkuGPFVi5qqqtvpNphRVY0Ys0xjwqFAX7NX8U_6FjGAqScoYJ-teTvdlfdjprM\n- GoPro Hero 9 https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero9-black/CHDHX-901-master.html\n\n‚öôÔ∏è See what I'm building\n\n- Subvolver: https://subvolver.com\n- Timeva https://timeva.app/\n\n‚úÖ¬†Follow me here\n\n- Website https://danisler.com/\n- Twitter https://twitter.com/IndyDevDan\n- Instagram https://www.instagram.com/indydevdan/\n- Indiehackers https://www.indiehackers.com/IndyDevDan\n\nüë•¬†Hashtags\n\n#webdevelopment #js #programming",
