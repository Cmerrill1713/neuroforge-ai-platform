  "description": "üî• Your IMPACT as an engineer is being HELD BACK by tools you don't fully understand. Here are 3 ODDLY useful Claude Code repos that NO ONE talks about - but could MULTIPLY your agentic coding power TODAY.\n\nüé• Featured Links:\n\nCLAUDE CODE USAGE: https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage\n\nCLAUDE TRACE: https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trace\n\nSNAP HAPPY: https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/snap-happy\n\nSIMON WILLISON: https://simonwillison.net/\n\nMASTER AI CODING: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?yt=nu3VDVzAVaE\n\nCLAUDE CODE: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\n\nüöÄ In this video, IndyDevDan reveals three powerful repositories that transform how you use Claude Code for agentic coding. These aren't just tools - they're force multipliers that compound your engineering impact exponentially. Discover how to track your Claude Code usage ROI, trace every single AI agent interaction under the hood, and give your agents EYES to see your desktop.\n\nüí° We dive deep into Claude Code Usage, showing you exactly how to measure your return on investment with a single terminal command. See real cost breakdowns and understand why your time is your most valuable resource - not API costs. Learn how saving 30-50 hours of engineering work completely changes the ROI equation.\n\nüîç Next, we explore Claude Trace - the tool that lets you see EXACTLY what Claude Code is doing at a fundamental level. Watch as we uncover the hidden system prompts, tool definitions, and sub-agent conversations that make Claude Code the most powerful agentic coding tool of 2025. Understanding these internals unlocks new ways to leverage parallel agents and programmable workflows.\n\nüñ•Ô∏è Finally, we demonstrate Snap Happy - a simple MCP server that gives your AI agents the ability to see and interact with your desktop. This is just the beginning of multimodal, multifunctional agents that extend beyond the terminal into the physical world.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Whether you're already using Claude Code or just getting started with agentic engineering, these tools will help you maximize your impact. The difference between vibe coders and great engineers? Great engineers know exactly what their tools are doing on a fundamental level.\n\n‚ú® Key Insights:\n\nTrack your Claude Code usage and ROI with simple terminal commands\nTrace every agent interaction to master Claude Code at a deep level\nGive your agents visual capabilities with screenshot MCP servers\nUnderstand how sub-agents really work under the hood\nLearn why tool mastery matters more than ever in the age of AI agents\n\nRemember: In the age of agents, knowing what your tool can do has an EXPONENTIAL impact on your performance. Every action, every keystroke is now multiplied by one or more agents.\n\nStay focused and keep building!\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 Claude Code compounds your impact\n00:42 Tool 1 - Claude Code Usage\n02:49 Tool 2 - Claude Trace\n08:43 Tool 3 - Snap Happy\n10:45 Shoutouts\n\n#agenticcoding #claudecode #aicoding",
