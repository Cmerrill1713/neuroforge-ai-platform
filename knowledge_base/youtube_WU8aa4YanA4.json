  "description": "Head on over to the Live Agent Studio now to get 100 free tokens to try these pre-release agents out yourself!\n\nhttps://studio.ottomator.ai\n\nbolt.diy has definitely kept me busy, but it’s important for me to continue focusing on building in the AI Agent space in other ways too. So over the past couple of months, I have been building up an incredible platform behind the scenes as a part of oTTomator called the Live Agent Studio! And it is now in pre-release!\n\nThe Live Agent Studio is a community driven platform filled with cutting-edge agents for you to try out and learn how to implement for yourself and your business. All agents are open source AND I’ve created a way for you and the community to contribute your own agents so together we can build the BEST repository of AI agents!\n\nMy goal is to build a truly revolutionary platform that’s a one of a kind. I have NOT heard of another platform that does all of the following:\n\n- Showcases a bunch of different AI agents\n- Makes every agent open source\n- Allows the community to contribute agents\n- Standardizes the integration so you can use ANY platform to build agents\n- Implements full conversation and chat history for every agent\n \nAll agents are open source and free to download, but we obviously require tokens to use them since we pay for the infrastructure, LLMs, and APIs for all agents on the platform!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheck out the pre-release of the Live Agent Studio now!\n\nhttps://studio.ottomator.ai\n\noTTomator - your one stop shop for all the knowledge, networking, tools, and resources to succeed with AI!\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai\n\nCome join the oTTomator Think Tank - home of the bolt.diy community!\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Introducing the Live Agent Studio\n02:39 - Live Agent Studio Overview\n03:44 - oTTomator - The Bigger Picture\n04:52 - Live Agent Studio Walkthrough\n07:35 - Pydantic AI Agent Demo\n09:40 - LinkedIn/X/Blog Content n8n Agent Demo\n10:51 - Business Idea Researcher n8n Agent Demo\n12:09 - Open Source Agents\n12:33 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
