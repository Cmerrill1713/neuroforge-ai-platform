It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[9] GitHub has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 and its headquarters are located in San Francisco.[10]\n\nIt is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[11] As of January 2023,[update] GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 420 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories.[12] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023.[update] Over five billion developer contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.[13]\n\nThe development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.[14] The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release.[15] Its name was chosen as a compound of Git and hub.[16]\n\nGitHub was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.[17] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.[18]\n\nIn 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to harassment allegations against its co-founder and then-CEO, Thomas Preston-Werner, and his wife Theresa. As a result of the scandal, Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[19] Co-founder and Product lead, Chris Wanstrath, became CEO. Julio Avalos, then General Counsel and Administrative Officer, assumed control over GitHub's business operations and day-to-day management.[20]\n\nGitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[21]\n\nIn July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[9] with a $750 million valuation.[22]\n\nIn July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[23][24] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.[25]\n\nAs of 2023,[update] GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue annually.[2]\n\nThe GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008.[26] The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[27]\n\nOn February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.\n\nThat same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,[28] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[29]\n\nIn 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[30] A year later, this number doubled.[31] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[32] On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[33] By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 10 million repositories.[34]\n\nIn 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the U.S.[35]\n\nOn February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.[36]\n\nOn June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.[37][38]\n\nOn June 11, 2019, it was announced that former Bitnami chief operating officer (COO) and co-founder, Erica Brescia, would be GitHub's COO.[39]\n\nOn November 3, 2021, GitHub announced that CEO Nat Friedman, who become CEO when Microsoft acquired GitHub, was stepping down as CEO and GitHub's chief product officer, Thomas Dohmke, would become CEO on November 15.[40]\n\nOn August 11, 2025 Thomas Dohmke announced that he was to step down as CEO at the end of 2025, to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors. Microsoft did not immediately share their intention to find a direct replacement.[41]\n\nFrom 2012, Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs).[43][44]\n\nOn June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion (~$8.96 billion in 2023).[45] The deal closed on October 26, 2018.[46] GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business.[47] Under Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI.[48][49]\n\nThere have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia's mobile business and Skype.[50][51]\n\nThis acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software.[10][44][52] Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage the use of its other development products and services.[53]\n\nConcerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors: Bitbucket (owned by Atlassian), GitLab and SourceForge (owned by Slashdot) reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services.[54][55][56][57][58]\n\nIn September 2019, GitHub acquired Semmle, a code analysis tool.[59] In February 2020, GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited.[60] In March 2020, GitHub announced that it was acquiring npm, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.[61] The deal was closed on April 15, 2020.[62]\n\nIn early July 2020, the GitHub Archive Program was established to archive its open-source code in perpetuity.[63]\n\nGitHub's mascot is Mona,[64] an anthropomorphized \"octocat\" with five octopus-like arms.[65][66] The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock,[67] a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images. The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.[67] Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.[67]\n\nGitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,[67] and trademarked the character along with the new name.[65] Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on The Octodex.[68][69]\n\nProjects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. In addition, the site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called Gollum), and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions (\"forks\") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.\n\nAnyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code. GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free.[70][71][72] On April 14, 2020, GitHub made \"all of the core GitHub features\" free for everyone, including \"private repositories with unlimited collaborators.\"[73]\n\nThe fundamental software that underpins GitHub is Git itself, written by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath,[74] Hyett, and Preston-Werner.\n\nThe primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the version control and issue tracking aspects of software development. Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows pull requests to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called \"committing\" and one instance of it is a \"commit.\" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.\n\nIn addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:\n\nGitHub's Terms of Servic...",
