  "readme_content": "# diffbro - AI Powered Peer Reviews\n\n*Your AI Peer Review Bro*\n\nDiffbro is a command line tool that gives you AI powered peer reviews on your codebase. Under the hood diffbro utilizes `git diff` and OpenAI's *GPT-3.5-turbo* and *GPT-4* to review your code and provide feedback on your changes. \n\nDiffbro is best used before you stage and commit your code to your codebase. Diffbro also supports full branch diff PR feedback as if it were an engineer reviewing your merge request (see `--peer-review` flag). Diffbro is designed to help you catch bugs, improve your code quality, and help you ship with confidence.\n\n![Diffbro Header](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/solopreneur-d8361.appspot.com/o/Diffbro%2Fdiffbro.jpg?alt=media&token=fefc8d90-10e2-4091-9b03-957af25aee3b)\n\n## Features\n\n- View all commands, options and examples\n  - `diffbro --help`\n\n- Run against local changes\n  - `diffbro`\n\n- Run diffbro against a branch and create a PR review\n  - `diffbro --peer-review main`\n\n- Different bro modes for chill, to chad engineer level peer reviews\n  - chill: will review your code like a chill bro (default)\n    - `diffbro --chill`\n  - mid: will review your code like a mid level engineer bro\n    - `diffbro --mid`\n  - chad: will review your code like a chad, staff engineer bro\n    - `diffbro --chad`\n\n- Choose which files to review\n  - Only .py and .js files\n    - `diffbro --only .py .js`\n  - Everything except .py and .js files\n    - `diffbro --ignore .py .js`\n  - *Defaults to [\".py\", \".c\", \".cpp\", \".java\", \".cs\", \".php\", \".vb\", \".html\", \".css\", \".js\", \".ts\", \".asp\", \".aspx\", \".cfm\", \".cgi\", \".pl\", \".cer\", \".htm\", \".xhtml\", \".shtml\", \".jsp\", \".jsx\", \".tsx\", \".vue\", \".solid\", \".toml\", \".md\", \".go\", \".rs\", \".swift\"]*\n\n- Choose your gpt model\n  - `diffbro --model gpt-3.5-turbo`\n  - `diffbro --model gpt-4` (default) (recommended for production code)\n\n- Summarize the git diff for a commit message or PR description\n  - `diffbro --summarize`\n\n- Override the default prompts with your own custom prompt\n  - `diffbro --prompt \"Below is a git diff of code.
