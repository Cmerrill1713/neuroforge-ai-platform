  "description": "Right now, the AI (over) hype is strong but one thing is for sure: Prompt Engineering is going to be around for a while. At first it was a meme, now it's a legitimate career move. In this value oriented video, we focus on 3 time saving prompt engineering techniques to speed up your interactions with Language Learning Models (LLMs). \n\nWe utilize 3 techniques: Capitalize Referencing, One Word Prompts, and Context Chaining; each designed to help you convey information with clarity and precision. By using these techniques, you'll reduce the size of your prompts by over a third of their original size. Great prompt engineering is all about compressing and enhancing the communication of information to LLMs. We demonstrate these techniques in real-time using ChatGPT powered by GPT-4, showing you firsthand the efficacy and practicality of these prompt engineering techniques.\n\nWith the rapid evolution in the AI space, tools like MetaGPT, ChatDev, DBGPT, and more have taken center stage. But amidst this whirlwind of AI advancements, tools, and programs, understanding prompt engineering remain paramount. \n\nThe Capitalized References technique shines in this regard, offering a unique way to refer to specific pieces of information in a prompt and store it for the LLM's recall. Then, there's the ONE WORD PROMPT method, enabling you to communicate to the LLM with a SINGLE WORD and a paste form your clipboard for the LLM to operate upon. Finally, Context Chaining introduces a path-like notation, efficiently guiding the LLM through the intended domain. \n\nType less, achieve more, and harness the full potential of prompt engineering with these transformative techniques. Subscribe to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of software engineering and practical, useful AI.\n\nðŸ¤– Let's code AI Powered Peer Reviews: Diffbro\nhttps://youtu.be/5oXh5SvPJ-M\n\nðŸ¤– Learn AIDER and become an AI engineer\nhttps://youtu.be/MPYFPvxfGZs\n\n\nðŸ–¥ Equipment\n\n- Mac Book Pro 16\" M2 https://support.apple.com/kb/SP890?locale=en_US\n- Fujifilm X-H2s https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x-h2s/specifications/\n\n#promptengineering #softwareengineering #gpt",
