  "description": "Join the https://bolt.diy community over in the oTTomator Think Tank!\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai/\n\nCome join me in the StackBlitz office hours today at 1:00 PM CST!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlbKobsqfdc\n\nOver the past two months, we as a community have been building up oTToDev - our fork of Bolt.new which we are building to be the best open source AI coding assistant! We've added so many incredible features over the last month especially to help you create your apps with AI! So far we are absolutely CRUSHING it. And now things are going to get 100x more exciting...\n\nLast week I announced that we're forming a strategic partnership that will supercharge the project beyond what we could have even dreamed about when this all started. And now I get to announcement it!\n\noTTomator and our open source version of Bolt.new, oTToDev, are partnering with StackBlitz and becoming the OFFICIAL open source version of Bolt.new - and we will now be called Bolt.diy!! In this video I share what this means for the project, I have a little chat with Eric (the CEO of StackBlitz), and I share a little bit about what's coming up for Bolt.diy!\n\nAlso HUGE SHOUTOUT to both the maintainer team for Bolt.diy (Chris, Eduard, Dustin, Anirban, Ed, Oliver, and Steven) and the StackBlitz team (Eric, Alex, Matias, Ari, and Kate) for making this all happen. You all are killing it! And shoutout to the entire community as well because without all of your contributions Bolt.diy wouldn't be even close to what it is right now!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is the link to Bolt.diy on GitHub. Check out the README to see future improvements planned! This is the NEW HOME for Bolt.diy, and the old link to my original repo will redirect here automatically. You will need to clone the new repo though!\n\nhttps://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - The Big Announcement\n01:03 - Chat with Eric, the CEO of StackBlitz\n07:48 - Just Sharing my Excitement for Bolt.diy :)\n08:23 - StackBlitz Office Hours Appearance\n08:38 - Thoughts for the Community\n09:02 - Our Community And GitHub Repo\n09:35 - Continued Creative Freedom for Bolt.diy\n10:01 - Divergence of Bolt.new and Bolt.diy\n10:34 - Thoughts on Losing the oTToDev Name\n11:06 - What's Coming Next for Bolt.diy\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
