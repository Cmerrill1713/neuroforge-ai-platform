  "description": "AI Coding Tools need to be SORTED: AI Copilots vs AI Coding Assistants vs AI Software Engineers\n\nüåü In this video, we break down the three essential categories of AI tools that every AI engineer needs to know: AI Copilots, AI coding assistants, and AI software engineers. Learn the differences, capabilities, and why these tools are revolutionizing the way we code.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è We discuss the power of 'tier 1' AI Copilots like GitHub Copilot and Supermaven, and see how they boost productivity with intelligent autocomplete features. Move up to 'tier 2' AI coding assistants like Cursor, Aider, and Continue, which take coding assistance to a whole new level with advanced capabilities. Finally, we briefly discuss the future with 'tier 3' AI software engineers like Devon and Copilot Workspace, and understand their potential to transform the coding landscape.\n\nüî• Watch as we demonstrate practical examples and high-level features of these tools, from basic autocompletes to advanced coding prompts. See how tools like Cursor's Copilot++ can streamline your workflow, making you a more efficient and effective coder.\n\nüí° Whether you're a seasoned AI engineer or just starting with AI coding, this video is packed with insights and actionable tips to help you stay ahead of the curve. Don't miss out on the future of coding‚Äîembrace these tools and supercharge your productivity!\n\nüëç If you found this video helpful, make sure to hit the like button and subscribe for more content on AI coding, AI engineering, and the latest advancements in generative AI tools.
