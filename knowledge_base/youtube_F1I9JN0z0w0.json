  "description": "Most AI agents are demos that work for one user - you. But what happens when you need to scale to thousands or millions of users, and the agent needs personalized memory and tools for every user? You canâ€™t build personalized AI agents that scale by connecting it to a single Gmail/Asana/Slack account, a single RAG knowledge base, etc. Your agent needs authorization to access user accounts and store memories for individual users.\n\nIn this video, I'll show you how to build production-ready personalized AI agents that scale using LangGraph and Arcade.dev - the platform that solves the authentication and scaling nightmare that breaks every other approach. This is what MCP wish it had - with Arcade, we can build agents that dynamically request user account access with OAuth on-demand and then cache the credentials going forward for a super smooth user experience.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Get started with Arcade.dev to build AI agents that can actually DO things:\nhttps://arcade.dev.plug.dev/7qAXRal\n\n- Arcade documentation for LangGraph integration:\nhttps://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\n\n- Here is the GitHub repo for the Arcade + LangGraph agent built in this video:\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/arcade-ai-agent\n\n- LangGraph memory documentation:\nhttps://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#long-term-memory\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - The Problem with Most AI Agents\n02:01 - Hyper Scaling Personalized Agents with LangGraph and Arcade\n02:59 - Demo of Our Agent with Gmail/Asana Auth\n06:48 - Introducing the Codebase for Our Personalized Agent\n09:14 - Code Dive #1 - Intro to Agent Auth with Arcade + LangGraph\n15:57 - Code Dive #2 - Deeper LangGraph + Arcade Integration\n22:12 - Code Dive #3 - Agent Memory and a Nice UI\n25:09 - Final Demo of Our Hyper Personalized Agent\n27:15 - Last Thoughts\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos every week - Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
