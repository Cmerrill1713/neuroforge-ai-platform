  "description": "üî• Claude Code prompt templates are the SECRET WEAPON every AI engineer NEEDS in their arsenal right now.\n\nSick of typing out the same complex prompts over and over? With Claude Code's prompt templates, I just unlocked 10X compute power with a SINGLE slash command - and you can too.\n\nüé• VIDEO REFERENCES:\n- STATE OF AI CODING: https://agenticengineer.com/state-of-ai-coding/engineering-with-exponentials\n- JUST PROMPT MCP SERVER: https://github.com/disler/just-prompt\n- PRINCIPLED AI CODING: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=zcHY88VI1oc\n- FUSION PROMPT CHAIN: https://youtu.be/iww1O8WngUU\n- CLAUDE CODE HAS CHANGED ENG: https://youtu.be/d-SyGA0Avtw\n- CLAUDE CODE OVERVIEW: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview\n- MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL: https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\n\nFast and easy access to compute is the winning condition for engineers in the generative AI age. With Claude Code's prompt templates, you can now store reusable prompts in your codebase as custom slash commands, allowing you to trigger complex multi-step workflows with a single command.\n\nI'll show you how I ran an ultra-comprehensive code review using THREE separate reasoning models (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini) in parallel, then fused their insights into one master analysis - all with a single slash command! This is the epitome of compute scaling for maximum impact.\n\nüöÄ These prompt templates are revolutionary because:\n- They accept dynamic variables for flexible, reusable prompts\n- They can be committed to your codebase as reusable assets\n- They trigger multi-step workflows with 10+ tool calls\n- They allow human-in-the-loop when needed\n- They support parallel model execution for diverse perspectives\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è The JustPrompt MCP server takes this even further by letting you run prompts against ANY model from ANY provider - Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, and local models too. When new models are released, you can instantly access them without code changes.\n\nüîç This is the future of agentic coding - where the prompt is the fundamental unit of knowledge work, and prompt templates are your gateway to massive compute scaling. Don't miss out on this game-changing approach that's transforming how we leverage AI for engineering.\n\nüí° Whether you're building AI coding assistants, personal AI helpers, or complex agentic workflows, mastering prompt templates will give you an asymmetric advantage in the age of AI.\n\nStay focused and keep building.\n\n#claudecode #aicoding #agenticcoding",
