  "description": "- Try Hostinger Horizons (code COLEMEDIN for 10% off): https://hostinger.com/colemedinhh\n\nAs powerful as AI coding assistants are, they almost completely lack two of the most important parts of context engineering - RAG and project management. I built Archon to solve this and completely revolutionize the way we code with AI today. I’m bringing it to you as a beta open source tool that I’m determined to build into the best possible tool for all AI coding. It’s a massive overhaul of my original Archon.\n\nNOTE: The logo has changed for Archon to keep our branding unique! The logo was too similar to some other things before, and it's nice to bring the shield back from the previous Archon.\n\nArchon is an entire operating system for AI coding. For you, it's a sleek interface to manage knowledge, context, and tasks for your projects. For the AI coding assistant(s), it's an MCP server to collaborate on and leverage the same knowledge, context, and tasks.\n\nIn this video I give you a full demo of Archon (currently in beta!), show you how to get started with it today, and even dive into the future of Archon with one of the other maintainers (Sean Buck) and how I’m integrating it with everything else I’m doing with context engineering.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- If you're looking to join a community for early AI adopters all mastering AI coding and sharing goldmines of resources with each other, check out Dynamous:\nhttps://dynamous.ai\n\n- Archon GitHub Repo:\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/Archon\n\n- Come be a party of the Archon beta launch party livestream this Saturday (the 16th) at 9:00 AM CDT!\nhttps://youtube.com/live/iz9V9dVtRto\n\n- Sean’s YouTube channel (it’s brand new - go support him now with a sub!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SeanWBuck\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Introducing Archon: the World's First AI Coding OS\n01:50 - What's Archon All About?\n03:04 - Get Started with Archon Super Easily\n05:08 - Setting Up Your Context Engineering in Archon\n06:28 - Crawling Documentation/Files for RAG\n09:06 - Project Management with MCP\n09:48 - Full Demo with Claude Code + Archon\n13:50 - Hostinger Horizons\n15:58 - Chatting with Sean Buck about Archon\n18:58 - The Vision for Archon\n22:37 - The Future of Archon (We've got Huge Plans!)\n27:49 - Get Involved with Archon!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos every week - Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
