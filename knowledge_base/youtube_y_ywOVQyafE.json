  "description": "ðŸ”¥ o3 Is Coming... PREPARE AND GET AHEAD!!! It's About to Change Everything! ðŸ”¥\n\nPrepare yourself for next generation AI coding with o3â€”rumored to surpass even the best of o1. \nIf you havenâ€™t tapped into the full potential of o1 (or o3-mini when it drops), you risk getting left behind. \nBuckle up, because weâ€™re limit-testing o1 right now to see how far we can push AI-driven coding before o3 hits!\n\nVIDEO REFERENCES\n- PRINCIPLED AI CODING: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding  \n- BENCHY CODEBASE: https://github.com/disler/benchy  \n- AIDER: https://aider.chat/  \n- M4 BENCHMARKING: https://youtu.be/OwUm-4I22QI  \n- o1 MODELS: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1  \n- o3 ARC PUB: https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough  \n- MORE SPEC PROMPTING: https://youtu.be/dDbfmRDWAv0  \n\nAre you ready for a taste of what o3 can offer? In this video, we break down how to use the o1 API to tackle massive AI coding tasks and set the stage for whatâ€™s next. Watch as we combine o1, deepseek v3 and Aider to draft huge spec promptsâ€”pushing the boundaries with advanced â€œarchitect + editor\" prompt chain pattern built into aider. Discover how a clear plan in the form of a robust spec prompt let you tap into the real power of o1â€™s reasoning model. We even revert the entire codebase (multiple times) to show how much you can really scale up your AI coding with o1.\n\nLearn to quickly generate ENTIRE features with o1 as an AI architect, and deepseek as the editor, this deep dive reveals the secrets. Whether youâ€™re an IndyDevDan follower, a fan of ai agents, or just exploring a more agentic software development style, the future is moving closer every day. And itâ€™s all about pushing your capabilities with o1 nowâ€”so youâ€™re ready to soar when o3-mini and o3 officially lands.\n\nAt the end we discuss Principled AI Coding - my take on the best way to learn AI Coding in the Generative AI Age. Focus on principles you can reuse tens, hundreds, and thousands of times. Principles over tools.\n\nWith o1 and o3 coming, the question isn't what can the model do. The question is what can we do given our abilities, principles and tools.\n\nStay focused and keep building.\n\nðŸ“– Chapters\n00:00 o3 is coming prepare with o1\n00:57 The Plan is the Prompt\n08:32 Scale your impact with o1 Spec Prompts\n15:03 o1 AI Coding limits\n27:27 Principled AI Coding\n31:27 o3 is around the corner\n\n#aicoding #aiengineer #aiagents",
