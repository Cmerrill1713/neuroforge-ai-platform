  "description": "Look, AI coding is DEAD weight IF you‚Äôre still stuck in single-prompt mode. Claude Code just unlocked PROGRAMMABLE agentic coding and the gap is widening fast. Use it or watch your compute ‚Äì and your career ‚Äì fall behind. ‚ö°Ô∏èü§Ø\n\nüé• IMPORTANT RESOURCES FOR YOU\n\nProgrammable Agentic Coding: https://github.com/disler/claude-code-is-programmable\n\nPrincipled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=2TIXl2rlA6Q_a\n\nState of AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/state-of-ai-coding/engineering-with-exponentials\n\nClaude Code: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\n\nCodex HALF BAKED Release: https://youtu.be/LEMLntjfihA\n\nClaude Code‚Äôs new programmable agentic coding feature blows past basic ai coding and dives straight into full-blown autonomy. \n\nIn this video, IndyDevDan shows how to turn Claude Code into an infinitely flexible engineering co-pilot that can grep, glob, bash, and even call your own MCP servers. Learn why agentic coding is the future, why cursor and windsurf can‚Äôt keep up, and how principled ai coding practices let you harness this power safely. We walk through real demos, compare Claude Code Unix-style commands to traditional workflows, and reveal three high-impact ways to scale your compute advantage today. \n\nWhether you‚Äôre optimizing a CI script or orchestrating programmable ai coding pipelines, this is the playbook for next-level developers.\n\nüìñ Chapters \n00:00 AI Coding is NOT ENOUGH\n01:16 Programmable Agentic Coding\n06:20 Claude Code is Infinitely Programmable\n10:52 Agentic Programming with Claude Code\n13:52 We need this to build LIVING software\n15:55 Claude Code, and Notion MCP for AUTOMATION\n19:07 Agentic Coding FROM NOTION\n21:30 Aider potential MCP support\n23:55 Principled AI Coding announcement\n\n#agenticcoding #aicoding #programming",
