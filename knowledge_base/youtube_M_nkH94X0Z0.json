  "description": "The new twitter API is coming soon - so let's get ahead of the curve. Using our new found Notion API skills we build an app that reads from a notion database table, automatically tweets and marks the tweet as delivered. For this video we'll use the old twitter API and upgrade as soon as Elon releases the new twitter API.\n\nFeel free to ask any question and let me know if you'd like me to share the source code as I build out this application from a simple python app to a fully hosted, automated, autogenerating, scheduled app.\n\nStay focused.\nKeep Building.\n\n\nüê¶ See the tweets generated by this app in real time:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IndyDevDan\nNotion: https://indydevdan.notion.site/Notion-Twitter-App-4665d65a36a946b4b21d15ef9adcf19f\n\n\n‚úÖ¬†Get started with the Notion API:\nhttps://youtu.be/KyllgpvQFuI\n\nüìÑ¬†Documentation\n\nNotion Developer Documentation: https://developers.notion.com/\nPython Library: https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py\nTwitter Library: https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy\n\nüíª¬†Convert your notion pages to lifelike speech.\nhttps://subvolver.com\n\n#Ô∏è‚É£ Hashtags\n\n#asmr #notionapi #twitter",
