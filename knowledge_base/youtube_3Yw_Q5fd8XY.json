  "description": "I wanted to give a quick update to you on the direction of my channel and my plans to 10x the value of my content for you and your AI journey.\n\n1. I'll be uploading once a week (Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT) instead of twice a week now so I can focus more on quality over quantity for my content.\n\n2. I'm going to be leaning more into what makes me stand out - my focus on the higher leverage skills for building AI agents like architecture, system design, best practices for building AI agents, etc. so you truly have what it takes to have a big impact with AI and not just build toys, demos, or simple automations.\n\nI'm super excited for what I have in store! I truly believe my content will simply be better in every way possible.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you're looking to join a community for early AI adopters to master AI & AI Agents and transform your career or business, check out Dynamous here:\n\nhttps://dynamous.ai\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. \n\nI'll be uploading videos weekly Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
