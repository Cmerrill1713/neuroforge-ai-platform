  "description": "OpenAI has JUST released their Agents SDK, a production ready upgrade of Swarm that makes it a walk in the park to develop AI agents and connect them together to build agentic systems.\n\nIn this video we'll explore the OpenAI Agents SDK together, build some powerful agents with it, and see if this is worth using compared to other framework options like Pydantic AI and LangGraph. Is it really production ready and not riddled with abstractions as they claim?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nStop blindly trusting AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf - it’s WAY too important to test your code and Qodo can help you with that on top of being a very powerful AI coding assistant. Download Qodo for free:\n\nhttps://www.qodo.ai/\n\nDon’t get me wrong, AI IDEs are fantastic, you just need to make sure you’re properly validating the code too!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAll the code created in this video can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents/tree/main/openai-sdk-agent\n\nCheck out the OpenAI Agents SDK on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main\n\nAnd here are the docs to get you started:\n\nhttps://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Introducing OpenAI's Agents SDK\n01:29 - Agents SDK Overview\n03:15 - Demo of What We're Building Together\n04:59 - V1 - Creating a Basic Agents SDK Agent\n07:11 - V2 - Structured Outputs (Reduces Hallucinations)\n09:18 - Qodo\n11:36 - V3 - Adding Agent Tools\n14:28 - V4 - Agent Handoffs\n19:25 - V5.1 - Guardrails (Big Deal)\n22:52 - V5.2 - Context Management\n25:04 - V5.3 - Tracing\n27:13 - Is OpenAI's Agents SDK Worth Using?\n30:37 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
