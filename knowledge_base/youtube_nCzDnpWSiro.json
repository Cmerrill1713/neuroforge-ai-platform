  "description": "I almost never post off schedule but this new secret LLM is worth showcasing. OpenRouter has recently partnered with an unknown model lab (OpenAI? Anthropic? Google?) to bring us a FREE prerelease of a super impressive new foundational model - code name Quasar Alpha. This could be GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 3.0, or none of the above - we have no idea!\n\nWith a 1M token context length and insanely fast speeds, it's definitely an LLM to try now and watch out for the release of. A lot of people are thinking this seems like a Gemini model, but it's hard to tell right now.\n\nIn this video, I test out Quasar Alpha as an AI agent builder (with Archon), as an AI agent, and as a coding assistant (with bolt.diy). The results were impressive and I'm VERY glad I spent the time trying out this model in depth.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe waitlist is now OPEN for Dynamous AI Mastery - an exclusive community for early AI adopters like you to master AI & AI Agents and transform your career and business:\n\nhttps://dynamous.ai\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuasar Alpha is currently available to use for free on OpenRouter:\n\nhttps://openrouter.ai/openrouter/quasar-alpha\n\nCheck out Archon, the AI agent that builds other AI agents:\n\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/Archon\n\nBuild your frontends with AI for free with bolt.diy:\n\nhttps://bolt.diy/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Introducing Quasar Alpha\n00:53 - Quasar Alpha Free on OpenRouter\n01:38 - Quasar Alpha Benchmarks\n03:12 - Quasar Alpha is SPEEDY\n04:56 - Building an AI Agent with Archon\n07:51 - Testing our Agent with Quasar as the LLM\n10:07 - Building Apps with bolt.diy\n13:24 - Is Quasar Alpha Worth the Hype?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. \n\nI'll be uploading videos twice a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
