  "description": "Two weeks ago, I released a fork of Bolt.new (dubbed \"Bolt.new Any LLM\"), one of the best AI coding assistants out there. A lot of you started to contribute more amazing features, and it became clear after only a week that we were already starting to build a community around making the BEST open source AI coding assistant out there!\n\nThere are a lot of HUGE updates to share on this project, so in this video I dive into:\n\n 1. Recent additions to the fork (lot of SUPER exciting ones!)\n 2. The Discourse community I'll be releasing soon for us\n 3. Applications opening up soon for core contributors to the GitHub repo\n 4. My plan to make regular content on this project to keep you all up to date and to keep the project moving along quickly and smoothly. Including a guide on how to run this yourself (both locally and self-hosting!)\n\nThe future of Bolt.new Any LLM (now called Bolt.diy!) is bright and I'm so excited to continue to see where we take this project together! The goal is simply to build an AI coding assistant that is easily accessible for everyone and can making coding a breeze even for non technical individuals!\n\nApply with the link below to become a core contributor! I've been so impressed with all of the recent pull requests - I would love to have some of you help maintain and grow this project!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro - Super Exciting Stuff Happening!\n01:04 - Update 1 - So Many New Features!\n01:35 - Update 2 - Discourse Community\n02:08 - Update 3 - Core Contributor Application\n03:32 - Update 4 - Regular Content for this Fork\n04:12 - Diving into the New Bolt.new Any LLM Features!\n11:43 - Future Changes for the Project\n16:12 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is the link to Bolt.diy on GitHub.

And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
