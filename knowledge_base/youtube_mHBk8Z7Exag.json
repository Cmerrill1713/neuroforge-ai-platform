  "description": "No matter what software you want to build, getting the best results with AI coding assistants is more than just your prompts - it's about creating repeatable systems that you can evolve to fit your needs and workflows.\n\nI've developed a complete system for designing custom AI coding workflows that work with your specific projects. These are the high level concepts that'll take you super far - how to design a process for planning, implementing, and then validating with AI coding assistants. Incorporating slash commands, sub-agents, validation gates, global rules, and more into a package that you can rely on time and time again.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Check out CodeRabbit - the AI-powered code review platform I use every day for Archon:\nhttps://fandf.co/4pFHygm\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- If you want to completely explode your productivity with AI coding assistants in a single session, check out this exclusive workshop I'm hosting THIS Saturday the 27th:\nhttps://dynamous.ai/ai-coding-workshop\n\n- GitHub repo with the subagents and slash commands:\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro/tree/main/use-cases/ai-coding-workflows-foundation\n\n- Archon: RAG and task management for AI coding assistants:\nhttps://archon.diy\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Why Build AI Coding Workflows?\n01:19 - The Mental Model for Building AI Coding Workflows\n03:08 - My Use Case to Showcase Workflow Building\n04:21 - The Planning Phase (the Most Important)\n10:00 - Planning with Slash Commands & Subagents\n16:02 - The Implementation/Validation Phases\n19:35 - CodeRabbit\n21:15 - Implementation and Validation in Action\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos every week - Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
