  "description": "If you're trying to learn AI agents right now, you're probably drowning in scattered tutorials and conflicting advice. Personally, I spent months when I was first starting just jumping between random resources, making zero real progress. Now after building hundreds of AI agents, I've figured out the exact roadmap I wish I had on day one.\n\nIn this video, I'll walk you through the complete roadmap I'd follow to learn AI agents from scratch today! By the end, you'll have a clear plan to go from beginner to building real AI agents fast. The world is your oyster when you know how to build AI agents effectively - don't miss out on this opportunity.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you're looking to join a community for early AI adopters to master AI & AI Agents and transform your career or business, check out Dynamous here:\n\nhttps://dynamous.ai\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nApparently YouTube only lets me add 5 video cards, so I couldn't add cards for some of the videos I mention towards the end. Here are all videos I referenced throughout the roadmap:\n\n1. Agents vs. Workflows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYFTQU2iV4A\n2. MCP Crash Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_6EXt6T83I\n3.
