  "description": "Three weeks ago, I released a fork of Bolt.new, one of the best AI coding assistants out there. A lot of you started to contribute more amazing features, and it became clear after only a week that we were already starting to build a community around making the BEST open source AI coding assistant out there!\n\nThere are a lot of HUGE updates to share on this project, so in this video I dive into:\n\n1. My livestream for the project I'll be doing on Sunday, Nov 10th at 7:00 PM CDT in place of my usual Sunday video!\n2. Discourse community for the project coming next Sunday (Nov 10th)!\n3. Core contributor application updates\n4. Giving the fork an official name - oTToDev (previously had the unofficial name \"Bolt.new Any LLM\", still working on changing that everywhere)\n\nI also show how to run oTToDev SUPER easily with Docker at the end of this video. No technical experience required!\n\nThe future of oTToDev is bright and I'm so excited to continue to see where we take this project together! The goal is simply to build an AI coding assistant that is easily accessible for everyone and can making coding a breeze even for non technical individuals!\n\nApply with the link below to become a core contributor! I've been so impressed with all of the recent pull requests - I would love to have some of you help maintain and grow this project!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro - Super Exciting Stuff Happening!\n00:47 - Update 1 - oTToDev Livestream next Sunday!\n01:08 - Update 2 - Core Contributors\n01:32 - Update 3 - Giving the Project an Official Name\n02:01 - Update 4 - Discourse Community Launch next Sunday!\n03:02 - Guide on Running oTToDev with Docker\n12:37 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai/\n\nHere is the link to Bolt.diy on GitHub. Check out the README to see future improvements planned!\n\nhttps://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy\n\nApply to be a core contributor!\n\nhttps://forms.gle/TBSteXSDCtBDwr5m7\n\nOriginal video on my channel for this Bolt.new fork:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3PFcAu_oU80\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
