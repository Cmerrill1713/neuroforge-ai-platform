  "description": "ðŸ”¥ I'll be blunt... If you're not using Devin, Cursor, or Aider for ai coding right now, you're already getting left behind! ðŸ˜±\n\nLet's talk about a powerful pattern you can use with ANY AI Coding tool to scale your AI Coding and Engineering impact.\n\nIt's much simpler than you think and it will pay you massive dividends in the new wave of AI Coding Tools with some form of Agent mode.(see windsurf, copilot agent, cline, trae, you've heard of them).\n\nðŸŽ¥ VIDEO REFERENCES:\n- SINGLE FILE AGENTS: https://github.com/disler/single-file-agents\n- PRINCIPLED AI CODING: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding\n- AIDER: https://aider.chat/\n- DEVIN: https://app.devin.ai/invite/4dR7aemlJqPiP3uZ\n- CURSOR: https://www.cursor.com/en\n- SINGLE FILE AGENTS VIDEO: https://youtu.be/YAIJV48QlXc\n- POLARS: https://docs.pola.rs/\n- UV SCRIPTS: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/\n- FIRE CRAWL: https://www.firecrawl.dev/\n\nðŸŽ¥ VIDEO DESCRIPTION:\nDiscover how to scale your AI coding impact with a ONE pattern for spec prompt-driven workflows! In this action-packed video, IndyDevDan shows you how to combine powerful AI Coding tools like Devin, Cursor, and Aider with cutting-edge techniques in agentic coding. Learn how planning and spec-based prompts transform the way agentic engineers leverage OpenAI and Anthropic models to deliver principled ai coding solutions.\n\nâ€¢ Learn how to create a rock-solid spec with step-by-step tasks that any AI assistant can follow\nâ€¢ See real-world examples where Aider, Devin, and Cursor tackle new featuresâ€”autonomously\nâ€¢ Understand why planning is vital for AI coding at scale, especially with advanced LLMs\nâ€¢ Discover how an effective spec prompt can drastically reduce coding errors and keep your workflow agile\n\nWhether you're deep into paic workflows or just stepping up your game as an agentic engineer, this video breaks down what's coming next in the ai coding space and how you can use this strategy to automate code generation and maximize compute efficiency. Explore how spec prompts fuel precise AI coding, allowing you to build scalable solutions without the massive overhead. Stay ahead of the curve with insider tips and hands-on demos that prove why AI coding is the futureâ€”and why you need Devin, Cursor, and Aider on your team now!\n\nNo matter what.\nStay Focused and Keep Building.\n\nðŸ“– Chapters\n00:00 The ONE pattern for AI Coding  \n01:30 AI Coding at Scale  \n07:00 Autonomous Coding With Devin  \n13:20 Scale Your AI Coding  \n16:00 Review Devin PR  \n22:20 Agentic AI Code Generation  \n24:17 PAIC Patterns  \n31:40 One Shot Spec Prompt\n\n#aicoding #aiagent #anthropic",
