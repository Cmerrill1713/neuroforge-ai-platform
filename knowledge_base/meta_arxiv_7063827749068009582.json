  "title": "LLM4MG: Adapting Large Language Model for Multipath Generation via Synesthesia of Machines",
  "description": "Based on Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), a large language model (LLM) is adapted for multipath generation (LLM4MG) for the first time. Considering a typical sixth-generation (6G) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, a new multi-modal sensing-communication dataset is constructed, named SynthSoM-V2I, including channel multipath information, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory data, RGB-D images, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. Based on the SynthSoM-V2I dataset, the proposed LLM4MG leverages Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3.2 for multipath generation via multi-modal sensory data. The proposed LLM4MG aligns the multi-modal feature space with the LLaMA semantic space through feature extraction and fusion networks. To further achieve general knowledge transfer from the pre-trained LLaMA for multipath generation via multi-modal sensory data, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning and propagation-aware prompt engineering are exploited. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4MG outperforms conventional deep learning-based methods in terms of line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS (NLoS) classification with accuracy of 92.76%, multipath power/delay generation precision with normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.099/0.032, and cross-vehicular traffic density (VTD), cross-band, and cross-scenario generalization. The utility of the proposed LLM4MG is validated by real-world generalization. The necessity of high-precision multipath generation for system design is also demonstrated by channel capacity comparison.\n        â–³ Less",
