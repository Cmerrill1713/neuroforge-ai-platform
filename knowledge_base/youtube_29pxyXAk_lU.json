  "description": "Merry Christmas from me and the team at oTTomator!! For a while now Iâ€™ve been teasing that I have a special gift just for YOU and today is the day!\n\nMy platform oTTomator is hosting a Hackathon competition for the Live Agent Studio with $6,000 in cash prizes!\n\nYou don't have to be technical to participate! Feel free to use no code tools like n8n and Voiceflow to build AI agents for the Hackathon! And if you can't participate for whatever reason, this is still a gift to you because agents created as a part of this competition will be available for you to try and implement for your own business!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAn AI Agent Hackathon with $5,000 (now $6,000 with the n8n sponsorship!) in prizes?! Register for it now!\n\nhttps://studio.ottomator.ai/hackathon/register\n\nRegistration is open NOW until January 8th and then the competition officially starts then!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheck out an awesome collection of AI Agents over at the oTTomator Live Agent Studio:\n\nhttps://studio.ottomator.ai\n\nAll agents on the Live Agent Studio are open source and well documented!
