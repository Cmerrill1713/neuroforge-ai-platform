  "description": "Everyone knows that if you aren’t using an AI coding assistant, you are going to fall behind no matter what you are developing. But what people usually don’t know is how to actually use AI coding assistants (Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, etc.) effectively.\n\nHaving a well defined process for coding with AI is crucial to consistently get high quality output, and in this video I’ll walk you through my FULL process as we use it to build a Supabase MCP server step by step as our example - all the way from ideation to deploying it. \n\nThis process will apply no matter what you are building or which AI IDE you are using, and I’ve got some resources to share to save you a ton of time setting this all up yourself.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheck out Global GPT as the most cost-effective way to get access to all the best LLMs in a single place:\n\nhttps://glbgpt.com/?inviter=Cole\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe waitlist is now OPEN for Dynamous AI Mastery - an exclusive community for early AI adopters like you to master AI & AI Agents and transform your career and business:\n\nhttps://dynamous.ai\n\nGoogle Doc for my full AI coding process:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/12ATcyjCEKh8T-MPDZ-VMiQ1XMa9FUvvk2QazrsKoiR8\n\nCheck out the Supabase MCP server I built in this video here:\n\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/supabase-mcp\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Introducing My Process for Coding with AI\n02:04 - The Golden Rules for AI Coding\n05:47 - The All Powerful PLANNING.md and TASK.md\n09:10 - Using Multiple LLMs to Plan (GlobalGPT Example)\n10:32 - Global Rules for AI IDEs\n13:20 - Integrating MCP Servers\n16:53 - The Initial Prompt for Our Project\n20:43 - AI Literally One-Shot My Supabase MCP Server\n24:01 - Project Backups with Git\n25:29 - Using AI to Test Our Code\n29:11 - Deploying Our Project\n31:38 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
