  "description": "CLAUDE CODE HOOKS just SAVED my codebase from a rogue rm -rf while my parallel agents chat back in real-time! \n\n(secret early bird launch: https://agenticengineer.com/tactical-agentic-coding?y=Kf5-HWJPTIE)\n\nIt's time to upgrade your agentic coding game (again lol). \n\nüé• VIDEO REFERENCES:\n\nPrincipled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=J5B9UGTuNoM_a\n\nClaude Code Hooks Quickstart: https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery\n\nClaude Code Hooks Anthropic Docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks\n\nUV Single File Scripts Breakdown: https://youtu.be/YAIJV48QlXc\n\nWHAT YOU‚ÄôLL SEE INSIDE:\n- How these 5 key Hooks give you surgical control over Claude Code, giving you next level observability and control.\n- Real text to speech notifications powered by elevenlabs (or openai or your local device), so your agents literally tell you when a top level task or an agent sub-task is done.\n- A full observability stack for ai coding: pre-tool, post-tool, stop, notification, and sub-agent hooks‚Äîall logged and organized for rapid debugging.\n- Why indydevdan calls Claude Code the new engineering primitive and how cursor is scrambling to keep up so much so that they've hired the creators of Claude Code.\n- Step-by-step breakdown of UV single-file scripts that glue anthropic, openai, and custom hooks together for unstoppable agentic coding.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n- Agentic coding ‚â† ‚Äújust chat‚Äù; with claude code and its hooks you control context, model, prompt like never before.\n- Parallel ai coding means spinning up multiple Claude 4 sub-agents that cooperate (or compete) while you grab coffee.\n- Block, log, notify, speak: plug into any point in the lifecycle of your agentic coding workflow.\n- Text to speech feedback isn‚Äôt fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs the missing UX layer for unattended long-running jobs.\n- Principles beat tools, but right now Claude Code is the fastest path to production-grade Agentic Coding.\n\nReady to turn your terminal into an army of disciplined agents? Smash play, steal the code, and start shipping 100√ó faster.\n\nNo matter what...\nStay Focused and Keep Building\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 Hooked on Claude Code Hooks\n01:10 Claude Code Hooks Breakdown\n06:25 When and Why Use Claude Code Hooks\n10:05 Understanding Uv Python Hooks\n18:57 Agentic Coding Wars\n27:25 Principled AI Coding and Phase 2\n\n#agenticcoding #claudecode #aicoding",
