  "description": "There isn't even a competition right now - Windsurf is hands down the best AI IDE. It combines the best of both worlds - it's super easy to collaborate with it as a Copilot, but it's also able to handle long running and complex coding tasks itself as an Agent.\n\nAnd because of that... I'm addicted. And in this video I'll show you how I've learned to use it to get INSANE results.\n\nIt's certainly not perfect - I still prefer oTToDev/Bolt.new for creating my initial frontends (great synergy there btw), and you still have to have a lot of technical knowledge to truly build something \"production ready\". But it's already saved me HOURS and HOURS of coding, which gives me the time to build on top of what it creates to make my projects super high quality!\n\nHow do I go about doing that? Well in this video I cover some tips and tricks that have helped me get the most out of Windsurf! These are pretty specific because the platform is very intuitive overall, but I hope that these can help you truly get the most out of this incredible technology!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:49 - What Makes Windsurf so Incredible\n04:34 - My Flow - oTToDev/Bolt + Windsurf\n05:47 - SEOWriting\n07:49 - Making You a Windsurf Superuser\n08:27 - Tip 1 - Restart Conversations\n09:16 - Tip 2 - Break Prompt into Smaller Requests\n10:12 - Tip 3 - Test Before You Reject\n11:10 - Tip 4 - Reject/Accept Specific Changes\n12:08 - Tip 5 - @ mention files/functions\n13:06 - Tip 6 - Describe Your Tech Stack\n14:20 - Tip 7 - Sometimes o1 Saves the Day\n15:14 - Tip 8 - Making Directed Changes to Code\n16:21 - Tip 9 - Document Your Code the Right Way\n17:51 - Tip 10 - Write Your Tests with Windsurf\n18:42 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSign up for SEOWriting with the link below and use the code COLE25 for a 25% discount!\n\nhttps://seowriting.ai/\n\nJoin the Discourse community for oTToDev, our fork of Bolt.new:\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes for you:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai\n\nWindsurf:\n\nhttps://codeium.com/windsurf\n\nThe initial prompt I used to create the app I show in the video:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yfzn3NqKSdBKiDYKPmSy2n-FvzvW5s06iO1dFon5Q0s/edit?usp=sharing\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
