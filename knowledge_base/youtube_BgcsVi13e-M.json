  "title": "Nuxt + Vercel KV: Coding an AI Agent Network MVP (flow state devLog)",
  "description": "Discover how to build an AI agent network MVP using Nuxt 3, Vercel KV Store, and Cytoscapejs. This Devlog serves as a practical guide, showcasing just a fraction of the potential of these technologies. In this video we build out the UI for an AI agent network monitoring system. \n\nIn the future (or should I say present), we'll be using agentic software to write code, develop ideas, work faster, prototype, create business value and much more. This devlog showcases what a simple MVP of an AI agent network could look like, so that we can more easily visualize, manage and understand our AI agent systems.\n\nüíª Tech & Tools:\nNuxt: https://nuxt.com/\nVercel KV: https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv\nCytoscape: https://js.cytoscape.org/\nTypescript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/\nVSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/\nNotion: https://www.notion.so/\n\n‚úÖ Use Notion?
