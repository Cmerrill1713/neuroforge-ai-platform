  "description": "There are a LOT of exciting things happening right now with oTToDev, our fork of Bolt.new that aims to be the BEST open source AI coding assistant. \n\nLast week, we launched our community over on the oTTomator Think Tank, and we've already seen a huge increase in engagement in the project after that!\n\nGiven all the recent work put into oTToDev, there are a lot of new features I want to highlight for you in this video. On top of that, l also cover a roadmap for oTToDev we've been working on and give an update on crowdfunding to support efforts for this project. \n\nAt the very end I walk through some troubleshooting steps for oTToDev as well to help you get it up and running yourself!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai/\n\nJoin the Bolt.diy (previously oTToDev) community over in the oTTomator Think Tank!\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai\n\nHere is the link to Bolt.diy on GitHub. Check out the README to see future improvements planned!\n\nhttps://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy\n\nLink to the initial roadmap I shared in the video:\n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/r/ottodev-roadmap-2ovzo\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:57 - New Features (PRs) in oTToDev!\n03:46 - Showcasing New oTToDev Features\n05:44 - oTToDev Roadmap\n09:44 - Crowdfunding Update\n10:26 - Troubleshooting Steps for oTToDev\n14:21 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value.
