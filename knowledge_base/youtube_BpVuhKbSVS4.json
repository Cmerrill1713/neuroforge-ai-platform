  "description": "Artificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nIn this video I show how to use a SUPER powerful AI combo - V0 + Claude - to build a Next.JS frontend for an AI app in just minutes. The app I build a frontend for is the RAG AI Agent I built earlier on my channel with n8n and Supabase that many of you got excited about, so this is a good extension of that walkthrough!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nEverything I go over in the video, including the n8n workflow, all the prompts, and the Next.JS code with my ShadCN components can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/ai-agents-masterclass/tree/main/v0-agent-frontend\n\nHere is everything you need for this walkthrough:\n\n- V0: v0.dev/chat\n- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: claude.ai\n- NPM installed on your computer: https://www.npmjs.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos twice a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT!",
