  "description": "Voice agents are HUGE in the AI space right now, and it's something VectorShift knocks out of the park that I don't see with many other platforms. I haven't focused on enough on my channel so I'm excited to share this to you today! In this video, I show you how to build a voice agent on your website that has all the power and customizability of one of my favorite no code AI automation platforms.\n\nVectorShift is similar to Flowise, Langflow, and N8N, but there are a few key features that make it stand out for a lot of use cases, and the capabilities around voice agents is definitely one of the big ones!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:31 - VectorShift Overview\n01:59 - Agent Knowledgebase\n02:57 - Voice Agent Workflow Build\n09:02 - Voice Agent Demo\n13:39 - Agent Frontend with oTToDev\n15:51 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheck out VectorShift today and build your first voice agent (not an affiliate link, it's a true recommendation):\n\nhttps://vectorshift.ai/\n\nI am building something big behind the scenes:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai/\n\nCome join the community for oTToDev as we build the best open source AI coding assistant:\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
