  "description": "Most no code app builders out there with AI integrations like Bubble have a TON of hidden fees that make the platform ridiculously expensive when you actually want to scale your app. Not to mention the vendor lock in makes it so you're stuck paying those prices forever... Been there, done that, NOT fun.\n\nThe alternative is a platform I found recently called Momen. Momen makes it so easy to build powerful AI agents AND integrate them with a frontend using their app builder - all without code! The best part is you pay directly for the infrastructure instead of paying per API call/DB operation like with Bubble, so your pricing is predictable (SO important) and not ridiculous. Don't get stuck on Bubble (or similar platforms) paying for every single time a user loads one of your pages. It's impractical.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTry Momen for free with the link below!\n\nhttps://go.momen.app/ai\n\nIf you sign up now you'll also receive 200,000 free tokens that can be used with any LLM you want! That's more than enough tokens to fully build out an AI agent application with Momen and see if it's the right platform for you.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
