  "description": "AI Coding Assistants are here to stay. So the only question is, how can you leverage them to become a more efficient and effective developer? \n\nEver imagined a world where your coding tasks could be completed with just a few keystrokes? Welcome to the future of programming with the best AI Coding Assistant. In this video, we dive deep into how AI-powered engineering is changing the game. We'll explore 3 One Shot Prompts For the best AI for Coding experience. We'll utilize Cursor AI, a popular AI coding assistant, to demonstrate how you can code faster and more efficiently. Keep in mind though, these one shot prompt engineering techniques can be used with any AI coding assistant. I often times go back and fourth between Cursor AI and Aider, all the ideas translate well between the two. Because it's really all about the prompt. Is Cursor the best AI for coding? We'll investigate that in another video. This is all about improving our prompting ability with 3 incredible one shot prompts.\n\nThe prompt is the new fundamental unit of programming.\n\nBy utilizing concise prompts with your AI Coding Assistant you can generate your python, javascript, typescript, and whatever language you're using, faster than ever. You will unlock lightning-fast coding speeds without sacrificing quality. Experience firsthand the power of prompt-based coding as we navigate through several coding challenges using AI in a production code base. Learn how to effortlessly add functionality, refactor code, and more with just a handful of well-chosen words. Coding has never been this efficient, or this accessible. \n\nWe'll start off with basic GPT-4 prompts but then we'll use the new claude-3-opus model to the test with a more complex prompt that will generate multiple functions for us in a SINGLE ONE SHOT PROMPT. We'll showcase why Claude 3 Opus is the best model.\n\nThis isn't just about coding faster‚Äîit's about thinking differently. Learn how the new wave of 'agentic engineers' leverage AI tools to not only code but also to design and ideate more effectively. We'll take you through real-life examples of how prompt keywords can drastically reduce coding time and amplify your creative potential.\n\nThese are just a few of the core ideas we'll have in our prompt engineering course. Coming soon.\n\nWe're about to blast through 10k subscribers, so if you're new here, hit that subscribe button and join the community.
