  "content": "ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in 2022. It currently uses GPT-5, a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts.[3][4] It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period marked by rapid investment and public attention toward the field of artificial intelligence (AI).[5] OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model. ChatGPT's website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally as of 2025.[6][7]\n\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[8][9] Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts. It has been lauded as a revolutionary tool that could transform numerous professional fields. At the same time, its release prompted extensive media coverage and public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.\n\nDespite its acclaim, the chatbot has been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use. It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data have been reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy. These issues have led to its use being restricted in some workplaces and educational institutions and have prompted widespread calls for the regulation of artificial intelligence.[10][11][12]\n\nChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been fine-tuned for conversational assistance. The fine-tuning process involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[15] Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses generated by the model in previous conversations.[16] These rankings were used to create \"reward models\", that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.[15][17]\n\nTo build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning around $1.32 to $2 per hour to label such content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.[18][19]\n\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to further train and fine-tune its services. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback.[20]\n\nChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia.[21][22][10]\n\nChatGPT is a conversational chatbot and artificial intelligence assistant based on large language models.[23] It can write and debug computer programs;[24] compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);[25] generate business ideas;[26] translate and summarize text;[27][28] simulate a Linux system; simulate entire chat rooms; or play games like tic-tac-toe.[21]\n\nUsers interact with ChatGPT through conversations which consist of text, audio, and image inputs and outputs.[29][30] The user's inputs to these conversations are referred to as prompts.[31] They can explicitly tell ChatGPT to remember aspects of the conversation, and ChatGPT can use these details in future conversations. ChatGPT can also decide for itself to remember details. Users can also choose to disable the memory feature.[29] To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by ChatGPT, queries are filtered through the OpenAI \"Moderation endpoint\" API (a separate GPT-based AI).[32][33][34]\n\nIn March 2023, OpenAI added support for plugins for ChatGPT.[35] This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram.[36][37]\n\nIn October 2024, ChatGPT Search was introduced. It allows ChatGPT to search the web in an attempt to make more accurate and up-to-date responses.[38][39]\n\nIn December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT with a telephone for up to 15 minutes per month for free.[40][41]\n\nIn March 2025, OpenAI updated ChatGPT to generate images using GPT-4o instead of DALL-E. The model can also generate new images based on existing ones provided in the prompt, which can, for example, be used to transform images with specific styles or inpaint areas.[42]\n\nIn September 2025, OpenAI added a feature called Pulse, which generates a daily analysis of a user's chats and connected apps such as Gmail and Google Calendar.[43][44]\n\nChatGPT was initially free to the public, and OpenAI planned to monetize the service later.[45] In February 2023, OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs US$20 per month. According to the company, the paid version of the website was still experimental, but provided access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, and faster response speeds.[46] OpenAI later introduced the subscription plans \"ChatGPT Team\" and \"ChatGPT Enterprise\".[47] What was offered on the paid plan versus the free tier changed as OpenAI has continued to update ChatGPT, and a Pro tier at $200/mo was introduced in December 2024.[48][49][50] The Pro launch coincided with the release of the o1 model, providing unlimited access to o1 and advanced voice mode.[50]\n\nGPT-4, which was released on March 14, 2023, was made available via API and for premium ChatGPT users.[51] Premium users were originally limited in the number of messages they could send to the new model, but OpenAI increased and eventually removed these limits.[52][49] Over many iterations of ChatGPT, plus users maintained more access to better models than the free tier provided, and access to additional features like voice mode.[49][48]\n\nIn March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and a browsing mode (with Internet access).[53]\n\nIn October 2023, OpenAI's image generation model DALL-E 3 was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration was using ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversations with users.[54][55]\n\nOn August 19, 2025, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Go in India, a low-cost subscription plan priced at ₹399 per month, offering ten times higher message, image generation, and file-upload limits, double the memory span compared to the free version, and support for UPI payments.[56]\n\nIn May 2023, OpenAI launched an iOS app for ChatGPT.[57] In July 2023, OpenAI unveiled an Android app, initially rolling it out in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, and the U.S.[58][59] ChatGPT can also power Android's assistant.[60]\n\nAn app for Windows launched on the Microsoft Store on October 15, 2024.[61]\n\nChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI; these cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\". Following ChatGPT's success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023.[62] TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.[63][64]\n\nScientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimated in 2023 that a series of 5 to 50 prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 0.5 liters (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 U.S. gal) of water for Microsoft servers' cooling.[65]\n\nOpenAI met Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI worked with a team of 40 Icelandic volunteers to fine-tune ChatGPT's Icelandic conversation skills as a part of Iceland's attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[66]\n\nChatGPT (based on GPT-4) was better able to translate Japanese to English when compared to Bing, Bard, and DeepL in 2023. Researchers suggested this was due to its higher ability to capture the context.[27]\n\nIn December 2023, the Albanian government decided to use ChatGPT for the rapid translation of European Union documents and the analysis of required changes needed for Albania's accession to the EU.[67]\n\nIn February 2024, PCMag journalists conducted a test to assess the translation capabilities of ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft Bing, and compared them to Google Translate. They \"asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test\". The languages tested were Polish, French, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Tagalog, and Amharic. For more common languages, AI translators like ChatGPT did better than Google Translate, while for \"niche\" languages (Amharic and Tagalog), Google Translate performed better. None of the tested services were a perfect replacement for a fluent human translator.[68]\n\nIn August 2024, a representative of the Asia Pacific wing of OpenAI made a visit to Taiwan, during which a demonstration of ChatGPT's Chinese abilities was made.[69] ChatGPT's Mandarin Chinese abilities were lauded, but the ability of the AI to produce content in Mandarin Chinese in a Taiwanese accent was found to be \"less than ideal\" due to differences between mainland Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Mandarin.[70]\n\nOpenAI gave paid users access to GPT Builder in November 2023. This tool allows a user to customize ChatGPT's behavior for a specific use case.[71...",
