  "description": "One of the most tried and true use cases for AI for any business is a lead generation agent that sits on your website and runs the frontend of your business while you sleep. I'm talking lead qualification, answering any questions, sharing products or resources, and collecting contact information for follow ups.\n\nA lot of platforms out there to build these kind of agents aren't great and it would honestly be better to build it yourself with n8n or LangChain. But that is NOT the case with Chatling - it's an incredible platform to build custom lead generation chatbots to put on your website and get you customers on autopilot. In this video, I show you step by step how to build a super practical lead gen agent with Chatling that you could easily take for your own business.\n\nI am sponsored by Chatling for this video but I have chosen them specifically to collab because I've found their platform to be one of the easiest to create these kind of lead gen agents so I truly wanted to bring this to all of you if you have a need for an agent like this!\n\n0:00 - Intro - Why use Chatling?\n01:27 - Platform Overview\n04:10 - The Basics for Building Chatbots in Chatling\n06:12 - Building a Lead Gen Chatbot with RAG\n13:48 - Testing the Lead Gen Chatbot\n16:51 - Last Golden Nugget\n17:54 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere is the link to try out Chatling yourself!

And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
