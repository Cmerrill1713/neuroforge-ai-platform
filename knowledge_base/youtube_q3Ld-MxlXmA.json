  "description": "LLM technology is breaking the limits on what you can build.\n\nIn this video we discuss core engineering principles and techniques essential for designing and coding sophisticated multi-agent systems. Discover the key to rapid engineering and productivity gain with a principle so potent that experienced senior engineers naturally learn it instinctively. \"Everything is a function\" isn't just a phrase; it's a transformative approach that will revolutionize how you architect, design, code, and deploy software, making the creation of AI agents and high-quality applications more efficient than ever.\n\nEmbark on a journey to automate the exhaustive process of YouTube content creation, from SEO research to titles, to thumbnails to descriptions to chapters. In just 3 videos, we'll automate the entire process. All you'll need is your rendered video. This series will guide you through building a YouTube automation metadata generator, showcasing how to leverage agentic engineering and LLM technology to streamline content creation. The how is more important than the what. Focus on the principles and the underlying strategies to replicate this solution to anyone of your applications. By breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks and employing AI agents judiciously, you'll learn to maximize efficiency and minimize manual effort. Whether you're a seasoned software engineer or an aspiring developer, this video offers practical insights and a solid foundation in leveraging AI technology for software development. Let's push our engineering into the future by practicing employing AI Agents to automate our YouTube Metadata content creation.\n\nI forget to mention it in the video but AI Coding Assistant tutorials are IN DEVELOPMENT! Super excited to share those with you and eventually lead the tutorials into full blown courses to push your engineering into the future of programming. Stay tuned for that. The initial set of tutorials will be released right here on the channel.\n\nüîó 2024 Predictions for AI & LLMs\nhttps://youtu.be/UES89QRc3Sk\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Text to SQL\nhttps://talktoyourdatabase.com\n\n#youtubeautomation #aiagents #gpt",
