  "description": "Archon is the first agent of its kind - an open source AI agent that literally creates other AI agents from scratch.\n\nI’ve been constantly working on Archon the past couple of months, and I’ve been making a LOT of progress! In this video, I show you how I used it to create an army of specialized AI agents that each use an MCP server to connect my primary agent to a bunch of services, including Slack, Brave, Airtable, GitHub, my file system, and Firecrawl.\n\nIt’s the beginning of the ultimate personal assistant and I didn’t even have to code it myself - that's the power of Archon.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheck out Vectorize to make your RAG pipelines a piece of cake.
