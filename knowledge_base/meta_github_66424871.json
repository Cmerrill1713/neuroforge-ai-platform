  "readme_content": "# PyTorch Examples\n\nhttps://pytorch.org/examples/\n\n`pytorch/examples` is a repository showcasing examples of using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). The goal is to have curated, short, few/no dependencies _high quality_ examples that are substantially different from each other that can be emulated in your existing work.\n\n- For tutorials: https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials\n- For changes to pytorch.org: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.github.io\n- For a general model hub: https://pytorch.org/hub/ or https://huggingface.co/models\n- For recipes on how to run PyTorch in production: https://github.com/facebookresearch/recipes\n- For general Q&A and support: https://discuss.pytorch.org/\n\n## Available models\n\n- [Image classification (MNIST) using Convnets](./mnist/README.md)\n- [Word-level Language Modeling using RNN and Transformer](./word_language_model/README.md)\n- [Training Imagenet Classifiers with Popular Networks](./imagenet/README.md)\n- [Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)](./dcgan/README.md)\n- [Variational Auto-Encoders](./vae/README.md)\n- [Superresolution using an efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network](./super_resolution/README.md)\n- [Hogwild training of shared ConvNets across multiple processes on MNIST](mnist_hogwild)\n- [Training a CartPole to balance with actor-critic](./reinforcement_learning/README.md)\n- [Natural Language Inference (SNLI) with GloVe vectors, LSTMs, and torchtext](snli)\n- [Time sequence prediction - use an LSTM to learn Sine waves](./time_sequence_prediction/README.md)\n- [Implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm on images](./fast_neural_style/README.md)\n- [Reinforcement Learning with Actor Critic and REINFORCE algorithms on OpenAI gym](./reinforcement_learning/README.md)\n- [PyTorch Module Transformations using fx](./fx/README.md)\n- Distributed PyTorch examples with [Distributed Data Parallel](./distributed/ddp/README.md) and [RPC](./distributed/rpc)\n- [Several examples illustrating the C++ Frontend](cpp)\n- [Image Classification Using Forward-Forward](./mnist_forward_forward/README.md)\n- [Language Translation using Transformers](./language_translation/README.md)\n\nAdditionally, a list of good examples hosted in their own repositories:\n\n- [Neural Machine Translation using sequence-to-sequence RNN with attention (OpenNMT)](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py)\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute your own example or fix a bug please make sure to take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n",
