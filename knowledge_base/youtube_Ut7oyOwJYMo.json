I'm Dan Isler, an indie developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nI've been coding for 10+ years now and after grinding out code for tech companies I decided I wanted to prove to myself that I could build valuable software on my own terms.

I'm learning to put together the remaining pieces in order to become a true indie developer. \n\nIn success or failure - I'll see you in the next one!\n\n✅ Let's hang on the internet\n\n- Website https://danisler.com\n- Twitter https://twitter.com/IndyDevDan\n- Instagram https://www.instagram.com/indydevdan\n- Indie hackers https://www.indiehackers.com/IndyDevDan\n- Light Bulb https://lbulb.app\n\n#️⃣ Hashtags\n\n#asmr #coding #chill",
