  "description": "Choosing ONE AI Coding tool is a mistake. OpenAI's new Codex, sits at the opposite end of the AI Coding Spectrum from Anthropic's Claude Code. \n\nKnowing the difference between the two is key to using as much compute as possible to ship your best engineering work.\n\nüé• VIDEO REFERENCES  \n\nLatent Space Claude Code Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDmW5hJPsvQ\n\nPAIC - Master AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=y-_xknNOapo\n\nCodex: https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/\n\nClaude Code: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\n\nClaude Code is Programmable: https://github.com/disler/claude-code-is-programmable/blob/main/claude_code_is_programmable_4.py\n\nüî• What‚Äôs Inside:\n- A live demo of Codex orchestrating parallel AI coding tasks  \n- 5 breakthrough insights from the Latent Space podcast with the Claude Code creators  \n- Why terminal AI coding always wins over web-only IDEs  \n- How composability and background tasks redefine agentic coding workflows  \n- The power of simplicity-first engineering: ship small, prove value, then scale  \n\nüí° What You‚Äôll Learn:\n- Why terminal-based tools deliver maximum control and performance  \n- How Claude Code leverages compute to run background tasks and parallel agents  \n- Key differences between Codex‚Äôs web app model and Claude‚Äôs CLI-native approach  \n- Best practices for agentic coding, AI coding, and scaling your engineering output  \n- How IndyDevDan uses these insights to build living software that works while you sleep  \n\nüëç Don‚Äôt miss out on the future of ai coding and agentic coding!
