  "title": "I Can SEE EVERYTHING: Claude Code Hooks for Multi Agent Observability",
  "description": "Multi-agent systems are SILENTLY EXPLODING, but there's a MASSIVE problem nobody's talking about...\n\nOnce you scale beyond one Claude Code agent, chaos ensues. How do you track what 5, 10, or 20+ agents are doing simultaneously? This ONE idea will completely change your agentic coding workflows for the better.\n\nüé• Featured Links:\n\n- Codebase: https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability\n\n- Previous Claude Code Hooks Video: https://youtu.be/J5B9UGTuNoM\n\n- Programmable Agentic Coding: https://youtu.be/2TIXl2rlA6Q\n\n- Claude Code Hooks Docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks\n\n- Principled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=9ijnN985O_c\n\nüöÄ In this agentic engineering video, IndyDevDan reveals how Claude Code Hooks enable unprecedented multi-agent observability. Watch as multiple AI agents work in parallel while a sleek observability system tracks EVERY move they make in real-time.\n\nüî• Discover the power of multi-agent observability as we showcase:\n- Real-time event streaming from multiple Claude Code instances\n- Live activity pulse showing agent workloads at a glance  \n- Automatic event summarization using fast LLMs like Haiku\n- One-way data architecture for maximum simplicity\n- Session tracking across different codebases and devices\n\nüí° This isn't just monitoring - it's about scaling your impact as an engineer. See how Claude Code hooks integrate seamlessly with a minimal client-server architecture to give you complete visibility into your agentic coding workflows.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Whether you're running specialized agents for web scraping, deep research, or complex builds, this multi-agent observability system ensures you never lose track of what your Agentic Workflows and AI workforce is accomplishing.\n\nüåü The future of engineering isn't about writing every line of code - it's about orchestrating armies of specialized AI agents. This video shows you exactly how to maintain control as you scale.\n\nDon't get left behind in the agentic coding wave. Master multi-agent observability and unlock the true potential of Claude Code AT SCALE.\n\nNo matter what...\n\nStay Focused and Keep Building\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 Claude Code Observability\n00:50 Multi-Agent Observability\n02:57 Application UI/UX\n11:48 Codebase Architecture Breakdown\n17:40 None of this matters if...\n\n#claudecode #multiagent #aicoding",
