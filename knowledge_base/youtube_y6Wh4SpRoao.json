  "description": "Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b was JUST released, an open source LLM that is fine-tuned for coding but also performs VERY well in agentic workflows. This model CRUSHES all benchmarks, especially for coding, and even outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o in many ways as you can see on the Ollama library page for the model!\n\nLet me just say - what a time to be alive! Especially for local and open source AI! I say the local AI revolution has started because Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b has really proved that we're nearing the point of local AI being as good as the big guys like GPT and Claude. It's only a matter of time.\n\nIn this video, I dive into my own testing for Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b, including trying it out with oTToDev (our Bolt.new fork) and an AI agent I created specifically to test new LLMs like this. I appreciate benchmarks, don't get me wrong, but I always want to try more practical things like this, and I wanted to share it with you too! And man, this model surpasses all my expectations and the performance of ANY other local LLM, even the larger ones!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:42 - Model Overview + Hardware Requirements\n04:22 - oTToDev with Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b\n06:10 - Codellama's Epic Failure with oTToDev\n07:45 - Novita\n09:43 - Testing Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b as an AI Agent\n15:12 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGive Novita a shot today - it's honestly my new favorite platform for GPU instances and LLM inference. Not just because of our collab for this video but because of all the features I talk about in the video that I genuinely appreciate - the insanely competitive pricing, flexibility of your GPU instances, ease of setup, and the uniqueness of their available models.\n\nUsing the link below will help support me as a creator as well! :)\n\nhttps://novita.ai/?ref=nmqzzdk&utm_source=affiliate\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQwen-2.5-Coder-32b on Ollama (completely free!):\n\nhttps://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder:32b\n\nQwen-2.5-Coder-32b on OpenRouter (not free but about as cheap as GPT-4o-mini!):\n\nhttps://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct\n\noTToDev (our fork of Bolt.new):\n\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm\n\nJoin the Discourse community for oTToDev:\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai\n\nMy LLM eval agent:\n\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/ai-agents-masterclass/tree/main/llm-agent-evaluation-framework\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!\n\n#Novita AI, #llm, #ai chatbot, #ai chatbot, #llama",
