  "description": "Try ChatLLM today to get affordable access to all the best LLMs with insanely generous usage limits for only $10 a month (first month free)!\n\nhttps://chatllm.abacus.ai/cmy\n\nI love using all the fancy LLM tools out there for tasks like coding, but sometimes you just need the classic ChatGPT-like interface to chat with the latest and greatest LLMs to ask for very specific technical advice or get help with the higher level details of your project. The problem is, all of your favorite LLMs are on different platforms and it sucks to pay $20 for GPT, and then $20 for Claude, and then use another platform for Llama, and then another for Gemini.\n\nThe solution to this? ChatLLM. You only pay $10 a month and you get access to a Bunch of the best LLMs with insanely generous usage limits - GPT-4o, o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 405b, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, just to name a few!\n\nAbacus (the creators of ChatLLM) has sponsored me for this video, but that certainly doesn't take away from the fact that this is honestly my favorite platform for interacting with all the best LLMs! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, the value is truly incredible.\n\nIn this video I dive into the features of ChatLLM so you can see that not only are you not missing out on anything by moving off of the other platforms like chatgpt.com, you actually get more while saving money.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:49 - ChatLLM Overview - So Many LLMs!\n02:43 - Playing Around with all the ChatLLM Features\n07:47 - Additional Features in the Platform\n09:45 - Outro\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nArtificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!",
