You might want to use this if you are a developer or power-user.\n\n### Building fastText using make (preferred)\n\n```\n$ wget https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/archive/v0.9.2.zip\n$ unzip v0.9.2.zip\n$ cd fastText-0.9.2\n$ make\n```\n\nThis will produce object files for all the classes as well as the main binary `fasttext`.\nIf you do not plan on using the default system-wide compiler, update the two macros defined at the beginning of the Makefile (CC and INCLUDES).\n\n### Building fastText using cmake\n\nFor now this is not part of a release, so you will need to clone the master branch.\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText.git\n$ cd fastText\n$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..\n$ make && make install\n```\n\nThis will create the fasttext binary and also all relevant libraries (shared, static, PIC).\n\n### Building fastText for Python\n\nFor now this is not part of a release, so you will need to clone the master branch.\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText.git\n$ cd fastText\n$ pip install .\n```\n\nFor further information and introduction see python/README.md\n\n## Example use cases\n\nThis library has two main use cases: word representation learning and text classification.\nThese were described in the two papers [1](#enriching-word-vectors-with-subword-information) and [2](#bag-of-tricks-for-efficient-text-classification).\n\n### Word representation learning\n\nIn order to learn word vectors, as described in [1](#enriching-word-vectors-with-subword-information), do:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext skipgram -input data.txt -output model\n```\n\nwhere `data.txt` is a training file containing `UTF-8` encoded text.\nBy default the word vectors will take into account character n-grams from 3 to 6 characters.\nAt the end of optimization the program will save two files: `model.bin` and `model.vec`.\n`model.vec` is a text file containing the word vectors, one per line.\n`model.bin` is a binary file containing the parameters of the model along with the dictionary and all hyper parameters.\nThe binary file can be used later to compute word vectors or to restart the optimization.\n\n### Obtaining word vectors for out-of-vocabulary words\n\nThe previously trained model can be used to compute word vectors for out-of-vocabulary words.\nProvided you have a text file `queries.txt` containing words for which you want to compute vectors, use the following command:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext print-word-vectors model.bin < queries.txt\n```\n\nThis will output word vectors to the standard output, one vector per line.\nThis can also be used with pipes:\n\n```\n$ cat queries.txt | ./fasttext print-word-vectors model.bin\n```\n\nSee the provided scripts for an example. For instance, running:\n\n```\n$ ./word-vector-example.sh\n```\n\nwill compile the code, download data, compute word vectors and evaluate them on the rare words similarity dataset RW [Thang et al. 2013].\n\n### Text classification\n\nThis library can also be used to train supervised text classifiers, for instance for sentiment analysis.\nIn order to train a text classifier using the method described in [2](#bag-of-tricks-for-efficient-text-classification), use:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext supervised -input train.txt -output model\n```\n\nwhere `train.txt` is a text file containing a training sentence per line along with the labels.\nBy default, we assume that labels are words that are prefixed by the string `__label__`.\nThis will output two files: `model.bin` and `model.vec`.\nOnce the model was trained, you can evaluate it by computing the precision and recall at k (P@k and R@k) on a test set using:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext test model.bin test.txt k\n```\n\nThe argument `k` is optional, and is equal to `1` by default.\n\nIn order to obtain the k most likely labels for a piece of text, use:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext predict model.bin test.txt k\n```\n\nor use `predict-prob` to also get the probability for each label\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext predict-prob model.bin test.txt k\n```\n\nwhere `test.txt` contains a piece of text to classify per line.\nDoing so will print to the standard output the k most likely labels for each line.\nThe argument `k` is optional, and equal to `1` by default.\nSee `classification-example.sh` for an example use case.\nIn order to reproduce results from the paper [2](#bag-of-tricks-for-efficient-text-classification), run `classification-results.sh`, this will download all the datasets and reproduce the results from Table 1.\n\nIf you want to compute vector representations of sentences or paragraphs, please use:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext print-sentence-vectors model.bin < text.txt\n```\n\nThis assumes that the `text.txt` file contains the paragraphs that you want to get vectors for.\nThe program will output one vector representation per line in the file.\n\nYou can also quantize a supervised model to reduce its memory usage with the following command:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext quantize -output model\n```\nThis will create a `.ftz` file with a smaller memory footprint. All the standard functionality, like `test` or `predict` work the same way on the quantized models:\n```\n$ ./fasttext test model.ftz test.txt\n```\nThe quantization procedure follows the steps described in [3](#fasttextzip-compressing-text-classification-models). You can\nrun the script `quantization-example.sh` for an example.\n\n\n## Full documentation\n\nInvoke a command without arguments to list available arguments and their default values:\n\n```\n$ ./fasttext supervised\nEmpty input or output path.\n\nThe following arguments are mandatory:\n  -input              training file path\n  -output             output file path\n\nThe following arguments are optional:\n  -verbose            verbosity level [2]\n\nThe following arguments for the dictionary are optional:\n  -minCount           minimal number of word occurrences [1]\n  -minCountLabel      minimal number of label occurrences [0]\n  -wordNgrams         max length of word ngram [1]\n  -bucket             number of buckets [2000000]\n  -minn               min length of char ngram [0]\n  -maxn               max length of char ngram [0]\n  -t                  sampling threshold [0.0001]\n  -label              labels prefix [__label__]\n\nThe following arguments for training are optional:\n  -lr                 learning rate [0.1]\n  -lrUpdateRate       change the rate of updates for the learning rate [100]\n  -dim                size of word vectors [100]\n  -ws                 size of the context window [5]\n  -epoch              number of epochs [5]\n  -neg                number of negatives sampled [5]\n  -loss               loss function {ns, hs, softmax} [softmax]\n  -thread             number of threads [12]\n  -pretrainedVectors  pretrained word vectors for supervised learning []\n  -saveOutput         whether output params should be saved [0]\n\nThe following arguments for quantization are optional:\n  -cutoff             number of words and ngrams to retain [0]\n  -retrain            finetune embeddings if a cutoff is applied [0]\n  -qnorm              quantizing the norm separately [0]\n  -qout               quantizing the classifier [0]\n  -dsub               size of each sub-vector [2]\n```\n\nDefaults may vary by mode. (Word-representation modes `skipgram` and `cbow` use a default `-minCount` of 5.)\n\n## References\n\nPlease cite [1](#enriching-word-vectors-with-subword-information) if using this code for learning word representations or [2](#bag-of-tricks-for-efficient-text-classification) if using for text classification.\n\n### Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information\n\n[1] P.
