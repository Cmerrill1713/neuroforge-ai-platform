  "description": "üö® Llama 3.2 Is Here... but how good is it REALLY? How good is any small language model? üö®\n\nüîó Resources:\n- Multi LLM + SLM Codebase: https://github.com/disler/marimo-prompt-library\n- Meta Llama 3.2: https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/\n- Ollama: https://ollama.com/\n- Marimo: https://marimo.io/\n\nüî• Small Language Models (SLMs) are heating up\nIn this video, we dive deep into Meta's Llama 3.2 3B and 1B parameter models and evaluate whether small language models are ready to rival the big players in the LLM arena. Using Ollama and Marimo, we compare the performance of Llama 3.2 against models like GPT-4o-mini, Sonnet, Qwen, Phi, and Gemini Flash. Are SLMs like Llama 3.2 finally good enough for your projects? Let's find out!\n\nüîç Hands-On Comparisons Beat Benchmarks Any Day!\nWe run multiple prompts across multiple models, showcasing real-world tests that go beyond synthetic benchmarks. From code generation to natural language processing, see how Llama 3.2 stacks up. Discover the surprising capabilities of small language models and how they might just be the game-changer you've been waiting for.\n\nüõ† Tools to Empower Your AI Journey\nWe'll also explore how tools like Ollama and Marimo make it easier than ever to experiment with small language models on your local device. Whether you're into prompt testing, benchmarks, or prompt ranking, these tools are essential for maximizing your AI projects and understanding what small language models can do for you.\n\nJoin us as we uncover whether SLMs like Llama 3.2 are truly ready to take on the giants of the LLM world. If you've been curious about the latest in prompt testing, benchmarks, and prompt ranking, this is the video for you!\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 Small Language Models are getting better\n00:40 How good is llama 3.2 REALLY?\n01:17 Multiple Prompts on Multiple Models\n08:32 Phi, Llama, Qwen, Sonnet, Gemini Flash model voting\n13:53 Hands on comparisons beat Benchmarks anyday\n18:38 SLMs are good, not great but they are getting there\n\n#promptengineering #softwareengineer #aiengineering",
