  "description": "ENGINEERS! If your codebase architecture isn‚Äôt optimized for AI coding, you're SETTING MONEY ON FIRE.\n\nü§ñ If you're using Claude Code, Cline, or Windsurf your codebase might be costing you HUNDREDS! IF you're not optimizing for AI coding tools, you're doing it wrong. \n\nLet's fix that.\n\nüé• Featured Links: \n\nPrincipled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=dabeidyv5dg\n\nClaude Code has CHANGED Engineering: https://youtu.be/d-SyGA0Avtw\n\nSingle File Agents Codebase: https://github.com/disler/single-file-agents\n\nSingle File Agents: https://youtu.be/YAIJV48QlXc\n\nEza ls Replacement: https://eza.rocks/\n\nAtomic Design: https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\n\nüîë AI Coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Aider have CHANGED software engineering, but your codebase architecture might be holding you back. In this video, IndyDevDan tackles a new bleeding edge GenAI questions - ai coding and agentic coding: what's the BEST codebase architecture for AI coding and AI agents?\n\n‚ö° If you're serious about AI coding and AI agents, you need to understand how your codebase architecture impacts your AI coding tools. Whether you use Cursor, Aider, Claude Code, or any other generative AI assistant, the structure of your codebase dramatically affects token efficiency and productivity.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è We'll break down key architectural styles including Atomic Composable, Layered Architecture, Pipeline Architecture, and the optimal solution‚ÄîVertical Slice Architecture. You'll discover:\n\n- How Atomic Composable structures simplify testing but complicate updates. \n- Why Layered Architectures are intuitive yet often token-hungry. \n- The surprising benefits of the Vertical Slice Architecture for AI coding tools and AI agents.\n- The elegant simplicity of Single File Agents and when to use them.\n\nü§ñ Stop wasting tokens on poor architecture choices. Start managing your context effectively, because when you manage your context, you manage your results.\n\nStay Focused and Keep Building\n- Idd\n\n#aiagents #aicoding #indydevdan",
