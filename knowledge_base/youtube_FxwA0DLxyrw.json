  "description": "üî• Is Anthropic HIDING Claude 3.5 Opus? ü§Ø Anthropic's Computer Use Bash & File Tools are NEXT LEVEL. \n\nüé• Video References:\n* Computer Use Bash + File Codebase: https://github.com/disler/anthropic-computer-use-bash-and-files\n* Computer Use Docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/computer-use\n* Anthropic Model Pages: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models\n* uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\n* My 2025 Plan: https://youtu.be/4SnvMieJiuw\n\nü§î Ready to unlock the full potential of Anthropic's new AI tools?\n\nüöÄ In this video, we DEEP DIVE into Anthropic's groundbreaking \"computer use\" tools, specifically the bash tool and file tool. These aren't flashy, but they're GAME CHANGERS for any AI agent or personal AI assistant workflow.  We explore how these tools empower developers to achieve asymmetric software engineering gains in the age of generative AI.  We‚Äôll demonstrate practical examples using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, showcasing how these tools unlock next-level productivity for AI agents, AI assistants, and personal AI assistants.\n\nüî• We'll walk through real-world scenarios, demonstrating how to use natural language to control your bash terminal and manipulate files with unprecedented ease. We'll even build a simple proof of concept, leveraging the power of Anthropic's bash tool and file tool within an AI agent context. This is a MUST-WATCH for anyone serious about maximizing their AI agent development with anthropic.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è  We'll also discuss the mysterious disappearance of Claude 3.5 Opus. Where did it go?  Was it rebranded, deleted, or is it just delayed? We'll explore the possibilities and discuss the implications for the future of Anthropic's AI models.\n\nThe power to control your computer through natural language is no longer science fiction. With these new tools, we're entering an era where AI agents can truly augment our development workflows.\n\nThe AI Agents are coming... No the AI Agents are here.\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 Anthropic has a VISION\n01:18 Computer use - Bash Tool\n09:04 Computer use - File Editing\n15:07 AI Agents & Where is Opus?\n\n#llms #aiagents #aiengineering",
