  "title": "Is Cursor's Copilot++ BETTER than Github Copilot? FAST AI Coding Master Class",
  "description": "The way we code is changing and evolving, and that means we NEED TO ADAPT.\n\nThe days of manually writing out every line of code is far over. If you're still typing every line - this is a wake up call for you. I don't want you to get left behind in the wave of LLM powered AI coding tools.\n\nKeeping your eye on AI Coding Assistants is critical to staying ahead of the curve in the engineering world where layoff rates are high and the competition is fierce.\n\nLet's talk Cursor Copilot++ vs Github Copilot...\n\nIn this video, we will compare Cursor Copilot++ and Github Copilot, two of the most popular AI coding assistants on the market.\n\nRight away though we have to make a differentiation between the two. Cursor, just like Aider, is a TRUE AI Coding assistant. It is a tool that is designed to help you code better, faster, and more efficiently. While the base version of Github Copilot is a code completion tool.\n\nCursor's new Copilot++ aims to redefine coding efficiency, allowing for simultaneous auto-completions and context-aware suggestions that will leave you in awe. This video is a testament to how AI can not only enhance but revolutionize the way we code. By enabling features like multi-line auto-completion and context-aware suggestions, Copilot++ is setting new benchmarks in coding efficiency.\n\nAI Coding Assistants like Aider are two of the best AI for coding, enabling you to think LESS about individual lines of code. They enable you to think about the bigger picture, and give you the ability to up level your perspective. Think more like a product manager, or UX designer, and use prompts to handle the more mundane lines of code.\n\nLet's walk through a solid front-end example using Vue.js, demonstrating live how Copilot++ seamlessly integrates into your coding projects, and drastically reduces your coding time while increasing accuracy. See it in action as we tackle real coding challenges, showcasing how every command leads to precision-driven results.\n\nWitness firsthand the magic of Copilot++ as we showcase its ability to handle multiple coding prompts simultaneously, from adding and removing divs and handling logic with high accuracy to crafting complex coding functions effortlessly. This video is your ticket to mastering Copilot++ and supercharge your AI coding and AI engineering abilities with LLM powered AI coding assistance aka AI Coworkers.\n\nðŸ’» Cursor Copilot++\nhttps://cursor.sh/cpp\n\nðŸ”— Vue Flow\nhttps://vueflow.dev/\n\nðŸ¤– What makes a TRUE AI Coding Assistant (TACA)?\nhttps://gist.github.com/disler/20ae1bf472dbe5b743a0161a9da42a42\n\nðŸ“– Chapters\n0:00 One of the BEST coding assistants\n0:25 Multiple Prompts - In Parallel\n1:00 Copilot++ \n4:00 VueFlow\n5:00 Iterative Prompting\n6:25 Copilot++ Multiline Completion\n7:45 Adding Web Documents To Rag Context\n10:35 Copilot++ Function Completion\n11:30 Copilot++ Intelligent Auto Rename\n12:20 Copilot++ Helping us again\n13:00 AI Coding Takeaways\n\n#githubcopilot #copilot #aicodingassistant",
