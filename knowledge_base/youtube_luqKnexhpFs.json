  "description": "The PROMPTS you write today CAN control THOUSANDS of valuable agents tomorrow. This is your blueprint to master Agentic Prompt Engineering.\n\n(secret launch: https://agenticengineer.com/tactical-agentic-coding?y=luqKnexhpFs)\n\nWhat's up Engineers - here's a preview of the phase 2 Agentic Coding Course extended lesson on Agentic Prompt Engineering.\n\nFull release coming September 29th - Can't wait to share the big ideas embedded in the course with you.\n\nðŸŽ¥ VIDEO REFERENCES  \n\nElite Context Engineering (Preview): \nhttps://youtu.be/Kf5-HWJPTIE\n\nPrepare the phase 2 Agentic Coding Course with Principled AI Coding:\nhttps://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=luqKnexhpFs\n\nIn the age of AI agents, every prompt you create becomes a force multiplier. One well-crafted prompt can generate tens or hundreds of hours of productive work. But here's the shift most engineers haven't made yet - we're no longer engineering for just ourselves or our teams. We're now engineering for three audiences: you, your team, and your AGENTS.\n\nThis video breaks down the 7 most powerful agentic prompt formats and the exact composable sections that make them unstoppable. From simple ad-hoc prompts to complex template meta prompts, you'll learn how to build reusable, battle-tested agentic prompts that work like Lego blocks - swap them in and out to scale your engineering impact with compute.\n\nðŸš€ What You'll Master:\n- The stakeholder trifecta for the age of agents (you, your team, your agents)\n- 7 levels of agentic prompt formats ranked by usefulness and skill requirement\n- The most important prompt section that drives 90% of your results\n- How to create composable prompt sections that scale across projects\n- The input-workflow-output framework for consistent prompt engineering\n- Control flow patterns for loops, conditionals, and early returns in prompts\n- Delegation patterns to spin up sub-agents and multiply your compute power\n\nðŸ’¡ Key Insights:\nThe prompt is now the fundamental unit of engineering. Winners in the age of agents are building libraries of reusable, battle-tested prompts with composable sections. This video shows you exactly how to join them.\n\nðŸ”§ From workflow prompts with sequential task execution to delegation prompts that orchestrate entire agent teams, you'll see real examples of how to structure prompts for maximum clarity and effectiveness. Learn why consistency beats complexity every time, and how to communicate effectively to the trifecta - yourself, your team, and your agents.\n\nWhether you're building AI coding assistants, research agents, or complex agentic workflows, mastering these prompt formats is your ticket to asymmetric productivity in the age of AI. Don't just use agents - orchestrate them at scale.\n\nðŸ“– Chapters\n00:00 The Fundamental Unit of Engineering\n01:47 Level 2 - Workflow Prompt\n15:25 Level 3 - Control Flow Prompt\n21:04 Level 4 - Delegate Prompt\n29:38 Prepare Your Agents\n\n#promptengineering #agenticoding #aicoding",
