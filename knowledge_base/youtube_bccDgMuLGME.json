  "description": "Let's see if GraphQL is hype.\n\nThis is my second crack at learning GraphQL by building an Express + GraphQL app.\n\nCheck out part 1 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrUAc0vHx8\n\n‚ùì¬†If you've used GraphQL, what do you think about it?\n\n‚ùì¬†If you haven't, do you think you'll try out GraphQL?\n\nüìï My story\n\nHey coders. I'm Dan Isler, an indie developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nI've been coding for 10+ years now and after grinding out code for tech companies I decided I wanted to prove to myself that I could build valuable software on my own terms. I quickly learned coding is only a third of the story. I'm learning to put together the remaining pieces in order to become a true indie developer. \n\nIn success or failure - I'll see you in the next one!\n\n‚úÖ Follow me here\n\n- Website https://danisler.com/\n- Timeva https://timeva.app/\n- Twitter https://twitter.com/IndyDevDan\n- Instagram https://www.instagram.com/indydevdan/\n- Indie hackers https://www.indiehackers.com/IndyDevDan\n\nüë• Hashtags\n\n#api #coding #nodejs",
