  "description": "Engineers, I just ran an Infinite Agenic Loop in Claude Code. Seriously, don't try this at work. \n\nThis Infinite Agentic Loop will break Claude Code by churning through ALL OF YOUR OPUS TOKENS.\n\nüé• Useful Resources For You:\n\n- Principled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=9ipM_vDwflI_a\n\n- Infinite Agentic Loop Codebase: https://github.com/disler/infinite-agentic-loop\n\n- Parallel Git Worktrees: https://youtu.be/f8RnRuaxee8\n\n- Claude Code: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\n\nüöÄ Engineers, I think I just broke Claude Code - the BEST agentic coding tool in the game. With just TWO prompts, I've created an infinite agentic loop that generates unlimited self-improving solutions. This is the kind of compute scaling that changes everything!\n\nüí° In this mind-blowing demonstration, watch as Claude Code fires off FIVE parallel AI Coding sub-agents, each generating 1,000+ lines of code simultaneously. We're pushing the boundaries of agentic engineering, through real agentic coding to discover what happens when you scale compute to infinity.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è What You'll Learn:\n- How to create an infinite agentic loop with just two prompts\n- The secret to passing prompts INTO prompts (yes, it's as powerful as it sounds)\n- Why principled AI coding matters more than ever when scaling compute\n- Real-world applications for infinite solution generation\n- The exact pattern for self-improving agentic workflows\n- WHEN exactly to use the Infinite Agentic Loop for your engineering work.\n\nüî• Whether you're exploring ai coding, agentic coding, mastering prompt engineering, or building the next generation of AI systems, this pattern will revolutionize how you approach complex problems. We're not just writing code - we're orchestrating armies of AI agents to explore infinite solution spaces!\n\n‚ö° Key Insights:\n- Scale your compute = Scale your impact\n- Great planning is great prompting (Principle 4/5 from Principled AI Coding)\n- Claude Code operates in the highest leverage environment: the terminal\n- Multiple agents working in parallel = exponential productivity gains\n\nüåü This isn't just about breaking tools - it's about breaking through limitations. Join IndyDevDan as we push Claude 4 and agentic engineering to their absolute limits and discover what's possible when you truly scale compute.\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 I just broke Claude Code\n01:30 Infinite Agentic Loop\n02:55 Fire off a new wave of agents\n07:30 Reviewing the Claude 4 Opus UIs\n11:30 Great Planning is Great Prompting\n14:40 When to use the Infinite Agentic Loop\n\n#programming #agenticcoding #aicoding",
