  "description": "Can Gemini CLI ACTUALLY compete with the KING of agentic coding, Claude Code? NOPE - BUT!\n\nThere're surprising features that make Gemini CLI and Gemini 2.5 Pro a future contender.\n\nüé• VIDEO REFERENCES  \n\n- Gemini CLI: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli\n\n- Principled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding?y=Go9W_h7kcjE\n\n- Agentic Coding UI Eval: https://github.com/disler/agentic-coding-tool-eval?tab=readme-ov-file\n\n- Claude Code: https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\n\nüöÄ In this head-to-head battle, IndyDevDan puts Gemini CLI against Claude Code in a comprehensive agentic coding showdown. Watch as we run both AI agents through 5 levels of UI complexity - from basic components to complex Kanban boards. Discover why the Gemini CLI can't touch Claude Code today, but why betting against Google would be a MASSIVE mistake.\n\nüí° We dive deep into the agentic coding wars, exploring how Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro stacks up against Claude 4 Opus in real-world engineering scenarios. Using git worktrees for isolated testing environments, we push both AI Agents and their respective models (Claude 4 Opus and Gemini 2.5 Pro) to their limits with increasingly complex prompts. From hero banners to multi-step forms, see exactly how these AI coding assistants perform when the pressure is on.\n\nüî• Key discoveries: While Gemini CLI is blazing fast (2x speed advantage), Claude Code delivers superior accuracy and engineering precision. But don't sleep on Google - with their massive context windows, automatic memory system, and the powerhouse Gemini 2.5 Pro model, they're positioning themselves as a serious player in the agentic coding space.\n\n‚ö° Whether you're exploring AI agents, principled AI coding practices, or just trying to stay ahead in the generative AI revolution, this comparison reveals critical insights about the future of software development. See why the terminal remains the highest leverage tool for engineers and how these tools are transforming our workflows.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è What you'll learn:\n- Real-world performance comparison between Gemini CLI and Claude Code\n- How to leverage git worktrees for parallel agentic coding environments  \n- Why custom slash commands matter for serious engineering work\n- The importance of principled AI coding in the age of AI agents\n- Which tool delivers better results for complex UI generation\n\nRemember: No loyalties. Focus on capabilities. The best tool wins.\n\nüìñ Chapters\n00:00 Gemini CLI is a Claude Code Clone BUT\n01:25 Agentic Coding Wars - Git Worktrees\n03:15 First Task - Install and Title\n04:35 Level 1 AI Coding - Hero Banner\n07:01 Level 1 - Stats Card\n08:28 Level 2 - Button\n10:10 Level 3 - Card Carousel\n12:50 Level 3 - Data Table\n15:24 Level 4 - Multi Step Form\n20:45 Level 5 - Kanban Board\n29:00 Final Thoughts on Gemini CLI\n\n#aicoding #gemini #claudecode",
