This video breaks down the THREE levels (plus a secret fourth) of context engineering that will transform how you work with AI agents like Claude Code. Whether you're drowning in MCP server tokens or struggling with exploding context windows, we've got the solutions you need.\n\nIn this masterclass on context engineering, we reveal why a focused agent is a performant agent - and how to achieve that focus through the R&D framework (Reduce and Delegate). Watch as we expose common beginner mistakes like wasteful MCP server loading and bloated claude.md files that are silently killing your agent's performance. Learn why context priming beats static memory files every time, and discover how to properly leverage sub-agents for maximum efficiency.\n\nWe dive deep into advanced techniques like context bundles and primary multi-agent delegation that the pros use to orchestrate entire fleets of specialized agents. See firsthand how to save 40,000+ tokens while dramatically increasing your agents' speed and accuracy. From beginner-friendly fixes to bleeding-edge agentic engineering patterns, this video covers the full spectrum of context management mastery.\n\nðŸš€ What You'll Master:\n- The R&D Framework for managing precious context windows\n- Why your claude.md file is probably destroying performance\n- Context priming techniques that beat static memory files\n- Proper sub-agent delegation to save thousands of tokens\n- Advanced context bundle patterns for agent state management\n- Primary multi-agent delegation for true agentic coding\n- Building specialized agent experts for focused performance\n\nðŸ’¡ Key Insight: There are only TWO ways to manage your context window - Reduce and Delegate. Every technique in this video fits into one or both of these buckets. Master them, and you'll unlock the true potential of tactical agentic coding.\n\nðŸ”¥ Whether you're fixing simple MCP server mistakes or orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows, this video provides the concrete techniques you need to level up your context engineering game. Stop wasting expensive Opus tokens on unfocused agents - start engineering focused, performant agents that deliver real value.\n\nRemember: Managing your context window isn't about saving tokens - it's about spending them PROPERLY. A focused engineer is a performant engineer, and a focused agent is a performant agent.\n\nJoin IndyDevDan as we break down 5/12 powerful context engineering techniques that will revolutionize your agentic coding workflow. Don't let poor context management hold you back from shipping incredible AI-powered solutions!\n\nðŸ“– Chapters\n00:00 Levels of Context Engineering\n01:23 B2 Avoid MCP Servers\n03:33 B3 Context Prime Over Claude.md\n09:00 I2 Use Sub Agents PROPERLY\n14:40 ADV2 Use Context Bundles\n19:11 AGE2 Primary Multi-Agent Delegation\n26:40 Prepare your Agents for TAC launch\n\n#contextengineering #agenticoding #aicoding",
