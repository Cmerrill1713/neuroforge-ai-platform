  "description": "Google recently introduced the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A), which provides a standard for AI agents to communicate effectively with each other. It’s very similar to how MCP provides a standard for agents to communicate with tools. And just like MCP, A2A is very revolutionary and certainly not getting the attention it deserves with its initial release!\n\nIn this video, I cover what A2A is, why it’s so powerful, and what the current limitations/concerns are. It’s worth spending the time to understand this protocol now - this is the future of AI agents and the way they will communicate with each other.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCheck out Lovable to build the application of your dreams with no code!
