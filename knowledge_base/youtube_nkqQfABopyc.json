  "description": "One of the biggest feature requests for oTToDev, our community driven fork of Bolt.new, has been adding the ability to load existing local projects into the platform to continue working on them. It's finally here thanks to Eduards Ruzga, one of the core maintainers of oTToDev who also has his own YouTube channel!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@EduardsRuzga\n\nLot of other amazing people making amazing contributions so I cover some of those as well in this video! We're knocking down all of the high priority items to really turn oTToDev into a mature project.\n\nALSO - Exciting developments are on the horizon for oTToDev. We're set to announce a strategic partnership that will supercharge the project beyond what we could have even dreamed about when this all started. Stay tuned for updates coming in the next couple of weeks!\n\nIf I missed a shoutout for you (lot of PRs coming in!), let me know in the comments and I'll add a mention for you in the pinned comment!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin the Bolt.diy (previously oTToDev) community over in the oTTomator Think Tank!\n\nhttps://thinktank.ottomator.ai/\n\nI'm building something BIG behind the scenes:\n\nhttps://ottomator.ai/\n\nHere is the link to Bolt.diy on GitHub.
