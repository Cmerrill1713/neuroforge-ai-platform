I'm Dan Isler, an indie developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nI've been coding for 10+ years now and after grinding out code for tech companies I decided I wanted to prove to myself that I could build valuable software on my own terms. I quickly learned coding is only a third of the story. I'm learning to put together the remaining pieces in order to become a true indie developer. \n\nIn success or failure - I'll see you in the next one!\n\n‚å®Ô∏è¬†GitHub Copilot\n\n- https://github.com/features/copilot/\n\n‚úÖ Follow me here\n\n- Timeva https://timeva.app/\n- Twitter https://twitter.com/IndyDevDan\n- Instagram https://www.instagram.com/indydevdan/\n- Indie hackers https://www.indiehackers.com/IndyDevDan\n- Pianist https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClqIkmmBrT7dwHhlQpz2S5Q\n- Website https://danisler.com/\n\nüë• Hashtags\n\n#copilot #vue #webdevelopment",
