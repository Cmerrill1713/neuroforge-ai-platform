  "description": "ðŸ”¥ Whatâ€™s next for AI Coding in 2025? Letâ€™s talk BIG bets to setup our engineering for BIG wins in 2025!\n\nIn this video I share the secret to how I stay ahead of the curve so you can too.\n\nVIDEO REFERENCES:\n\nPrincipled AI Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/principled-ai-coding\nAI Coding Tool Breakdown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j_fgMPJGM0\n2024 Predictions: https://youtu.be/UES89QRc3Sk\nSimon Willison: https://simonwillison.net/\nPaul Gauthier (Aiderâ€™s creator): https://x.com/paulgauthier\n\nIn this explosive prediction video, IndyDevDan reveals his top 2025 predictions for GenAI, covering everything from AI Coding to the rise of Agentic Coding tools like Devin. Discover how AI coding tools like aider and cursor are transforming our industry, why generative ai will dominate, and what Gemini from OpenAI and Anthorpic might bring next. Whether youâ€™re worried about junior dev roles or excited to embrace these changes, this video is your roadmap for STAYING AHEAD in the rapidly evolving AI coding landscape.\n\nIn this video we discuss: \n- Why itâ€™s crucial to make predictions â€” and bet big on them\n- Discuss predictions around AI Coding, LLMs, AI Agents, and Agentics\n- We firmly bet that THERE IS NO WALL and create strategies around capitalizing on the continuing trend of improved language models. Both reasoning and base models.\n- How smart engineers are looking at large language models and rethinking their entire developer workflow around them\n- Why you should never bet against top researchers (there is no wall)\n- Key insights on harnessing generative AI for maximum ROI in 2025\n- A second look at what Principled AI Coding can do for your future success as an engineer in the generative AI age\n\nDonâ€™t miss this deep dive into the future of AI engineering. \nWatch now and learn how to position yourself for success in 2025 and beyond!\n\nStay focused and keep building.\n\n- IndyDevDan\n\nðŸ“– Chapters\n00:00 Annual 2025 GenAI Predictions\n01:30 Why make predictions?\n07:35 AI Coding, LLMs, Big Tech Predictions\n25:05 Principled AI Coding\n31:54 2024 Prediction Review\n37:16 Turn your bets into results\n\n#genai #aicoding #agentic",
