  "description": "Here is everything you need to know to crush building anything with Claude Code! These are the strategies used by top engineers to code reliably and unbelievably fast with AI coding assistants. \n\nWe'll hit on every core feature of Claude Code and how they apply to other AI coding assistants as well - global rules, slash commands, MCP servers, advanced context engineering, subagents, hooks, \"yolo mode\", and parallel agent workflows.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- If you're looking to join a community for early AI adopters all mastering AI coding and sharing goldmines of resources with each other, check out Dynamous:\nhttps://dynamous.ai\n\n- Come be a part of the Archon beta launch - Saturday the 16th at 9:00 AM CDT!
