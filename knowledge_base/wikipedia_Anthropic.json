According to the company, it researches and develops AI to \"study their safety properties at the technological frontier\" and use this research to deploy safe models for the public.[6][7]\n\nAnthropic was founded by former members of OpenAI, including siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei (who serves as CEO).[8] In September 2023, Amazon announced an investment of up to $4 billion, followed by a $2 billion commitment from Google in the following month.[9][10][11] As of SeptemberÂ 2025,[update] Anthropic is the fourth most valuable private company globally, valued at over $183 billion.[12][13]\n\nAnthropic was founded in 2021 by seven former employees of OpenAI, including siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research.[14][15]\n\nIn April 2022, Anthropic announced it had received $580 million in funding,[16] including a $500 million investment from FTX under the leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried.[17][3]\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Anthropic finished training the first version of Claude but did not release it, mentioning the need for further internal safety testing and the desire to avoid initiating a potentially hazardous race to develop increasingly powerful AI systems.[18]\n\nIn September 2023, Amazon announced a partnership with Anthropic, with Amazon becoming a minority stakeholder by initially investing $1.25 billion, and planning a total investment of $4 billion.[9] The additional $2.75 billion were invested in March 2024.[19] In November 2024, Amazon invested another $4 billion, doubling its total investments.[20] As part of the deal, Anthropic would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and make its AI models available to AWS customers.[9][21]\n\nIn October 2023, Google invested $500 million in Anthropic, and committed to an additional $1.5 billion over time.[11] In March 2025, Google agreed to invest another $1 billion in Anthropic.[22]\n\nIn February 2024, Anthropic hired former Google Books head of partnerships Tom Turvey, and tasked him with obtaining \"all the books in the world\".[23] The company then began using destructive book scanning to digitize \"millions\" of books to train Claude.[23]\n\nIn March 2024, Amazon maxed out its potential investment from the agreement made in the prior year by investing another US$2.75 billion into Anthropic, completing its $4 billion investment.[10]\n\nIn November 2024, Amazon announced a new investment of $4 billion in Anthropic (bringing its total investment to $8 billion), including an agreement to increase the use of Amazon's AI chips for training and running Anthropic's large language models.[24]\n\nIn 2024, Anthropic attracted several notable employees from OpenAI, including Jan Leike, John Schulman, and Durk Kingma.[25]\n\nThe company raised $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round in March, achieving a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from several major investors.[26][27] In March, Databricks and Anthropic announced that Claude would be integrated into the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform.[28][29]\n\nIn May, the company announced Claude 4, introducing both Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 with improved coding capabilities and other new features.[30] The company also introduced new API capabilities including the Model Context Protocol (MCP) connector.[30] In May, Anthropic launched a web search API that enabled Claude to access real-time information from the internet.[31] Claude Code, Anthropic's coding assistant, transitioned from research preview to general availability, featuring integrations with VS Code and JetBrains IDEs and support for GitHub Actions.[30]\n\nIn September 2025, Anthropic completed a Series F funding round, raising US $13 billion at a post-money valuation of $183 billion. The round was co-led by Iconiq Capital, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from the Qatar Investment Authority and other investors.[32][33] The same month, Anthropic announced that it would stop selling its products to groups majority-owned by Chinese, Russian, Iranian, or North Korean entities due to national security concerns.[34]\n\nAccording to Anthropic, the company's goal is to research the safety and reliability of artificial intelligence systems.[7] The Amodei siblings were among those who left OpenAI due to directional differences.[15]\n\nAnthropic incorporated itself as a Delaware public-benefit corporation (PBC), which enables directors to balance the financial interests of stockholders with its public benefit purpose.[35]\n\nAnthropic's \"Long-Term Benefit Trust\" is a purpose trust for \"the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity\". It holds Class T shares in the PBC which allow it to elect directors onto Anthropic's board.[36][37] As of April 2025, the members of the Trust are Neil Buddy Shah, Kanika Bahl and Zach Robinson.[38]\n\nInvestors include Amazon.com for $8 billion,[24] Google for $2 billion,[11] and Menlo Ventures for $750 million.[39]\n\nClaude incorporates \"Constitutional AI\" to set safety guidelines for the model's output.[44] The name, \"Claude\", was chosen either as a reference to mathematician Claude Shannon, or as a male name to contrast the female names of other A.I. assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Cortana.[3]\n\nAnthropic initially released two versions of its model, Claude and Claude Instant, in March 2023, with the latter being a more lightweight model.[45][46][47] The next iteration, Claude 2, was launched in July 2023.[48] Unlike Claude, which was only available to select users, Claude 2 is available for public use.[49]\n\nClaude 3 was released in March 2024, with three language models: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku.[50][51] The Opus model is the largest. According to Anthropic, it outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, and Google's Gemini Ultra, in benchmark tests at the time. Sonnet and Haiku are Anthropic's medium- and small-sized models, respectively. All three models can accept image input.[50] Amazon has added Claude 3 to its cloud AI service Bedrock.[52]\n\nIn May 2024, Anthropic announced the Claude Team plan, its first enterprise offering for Claude, and Claude iOS app.[53]\n\nIn June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated significantly improved performance on benchmarks compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, notably in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, chart interpretation, and text extraction from images. Released alongside 3.5 Sonnet was the new Artifacts capability in which Claude was able to create code in a dedicated window in the interface and preview select code in real time such as websites or SVGs.[54]\n\nIn October 2024, Anthropic released an improved version of Claude 3.5, along with a beta feature called \"Computer use\", which enables Claude to take screenshots, click, and type text.[55]\n\nIn November 2024, Palantir announced a partnership with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services to provide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to Claude 3 and 3.5. According to Palantir, this was the first time that Claude would be used in \"classified environments\".[56]\n\nIn December 2024, Claude 3.5 Haiku was made available to all users on web and mobile platforms.[57]\n\nIn February 2025, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was introduced to all paid users. It is a \"hybrid reasoning\" model (one that responds directly to simple queries, while taking more time for complex problems).[58][59]\n\nIn May 2025, Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet were introduced. With these models, Anthropic also introduced Extended thinking with tool use and the ability to use tools in parallel.[60]\n\nIn August 2025, Claude Opus 4.1 was introduced.[61]\n\nAnthropic partnered with Palantir and Amazon Web Services in November 2024 to provide the Claude model to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies.[62][63] In June 2025, Anthropic announced a \"Claude Gov\" model. Ars Technica reported that, as of June 2025, it was in use at multiple US national security agencies.[64]\n\nIn July 2025, the United States Department of Defense announced that Anthropic had received a $200 million contract for AI in the military, along with Google, OpenAI, and xAI.[65]\n\nIn August 2025, Anthropic launched a Higher Education Advisory Board, chaired by Rick Levin, former president of Yale University (1993-2013) and former CEO of Coursera (2014-2017).[66]\n\nAccording to Anthropic, Constitutional AI (CAI) is a framework developed to align AI systems with human values and ensure that they are helpful, harmless, and honest.[14][67] Within this framework, humans provide a set of rules describing the desired behavior of the AI system, known as the \"constitution\".[67] The AI system evaluates the generated output and then adjusts the AI models to better fit the constitution.[67] The self-reinforcing process aims to avoid harm, respect preferences, and provide true information.[67]\n\nSome of the principles of Claude 2's constitution are derived from documents such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Apple's terms of service.[48] For example, one rule from the UN Declaration applied in Claude 2's CAI states \"Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality and a sense of brotherhood.\"[48]\n\nAnthropic also publishes research on the interpretability of machine learning systems, focusing on the transformer architecture.[14][68][69]\n\nPart of Anthropic's research aims to be able to automatically identify \"features\" in generative pretrained transformers like Claude. In a neural network, a feature is a pattern of neural activations that corresponds to a concept. In 2024, using a compute-intensive technique called \"dictionary learning\", Anthropic was able to identify millions of features in ...",
