## üîç **Key Findings from Real AI Models**

### **‚úÖ What Works Well:**
1. **4-panel layout** - Intuitive separation of chat, code, multimodal, and learning
2. **8 AI model selector** - Good diversity of specialized roles
3. **Monaco code editor** - Professional coding environment with syntax highlighting
4. **Dark/light mode toggle** - Good accessibility feature
5. **Real-time chat interface** - Responsive communication

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Performance lag** - Monaco editor struggles with large files
2. **Image upload guidance** - Users need clearer instructions for LLaVA
3. **Model integration** - AI model selector needs better tooltips/descriptions
4. **Multimodal integration** - Not well connected with other panels
5. **Progress visualization** - Basic achievement system needs enhancement

### **üöÄ Top Priority Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced model descriptions** - Add detailed tooltips for each AI model
2. **Image upload tutorial** - Step-by-step guidance for LLaVA analysis
3. **Performance optimization** - Fix Monaco editor lag with large files
4. **Better progress tracking** - More engaging visualizations
5. **Real-time collaboration** - Multi-user features
