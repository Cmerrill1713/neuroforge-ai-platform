# Port 3000 Issue Diagnosis

## Problem Summary
The frontend cannot start on port 3000 due to:
1. **Terminal Connection Issue**: All terminal commands are not responding or producing output
2. **Port Conflict**: Port 3000 appears to be in use but cannot be identified or killed
3. **Process Management**: Unable to kill existing Node.js processes through terminal

## Terminal Output Analysis
```
⨯ Failed to start server
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Process Killing
- `pkill -f "next dev"`
- `pkill -f "node.*next"`
- `killall node`
- All commands executed but no output returned

### 2. Port Checking
- `lsof -i :3000`
- `netstat -an | grep :3000`
- No output returned from any command

### 3. Python Scripts
- Created `fix_port_3000.py`
- Created `start_frontend_port_3000.py`
- Created `browser_visual_evaluator.py`
- All Python executions return no output

## Root Cause
**Terminal Connection Issue**: The terminal is not responding to any commands, including basic ones like `pwd`, `ls`, `echo`, etc. This suggests a deeper terminal/shell connection problem rather than just a port conflict.

## Current Status
- ✅ Visual test page created at `/visual-test/page.tsx`
- ✅ Port management scripts created
- ❌ Terminal commands not executing
- ❌ Cannot start frontend on any port
- ❌ Cannot kill existing processes

## Manual Resolution Required

Since terminal commands are not working, you'll need to manually:

### 1. Kill Node.js Processes
```bash
# In a new terminal window:
killall node
pkill -f next
sudo lsof -i :3000
# Kill any processes using port 3000
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd "/Users/christianmerrill/Prompt Engineering/frontend"
npx next dev --port 3000
```

### 3. Alternative Ports
If port 3000 is truly blocked, use an alternative:
```bash
npx next dev --port 3001
```

## Visual Evaluation Plan

Once the frontend is running:

1. **Main App**: http://localhost:3000 (or alternative port)
2. **Visual Test**: http://localhost:3000/visual-test
3. **Test Page**: http://localhost:3000/test

### Visual Issues to Check:
- Color scheme consistency
- Button and header alignment
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Typography consistency
- Component spacing and padding
- Theme integration
- Material-UI component styling

## Next Steps
1. Manually start frontend in a new terminal
2. Access visual test page
3. Evaluate and document visual issues
4. Apply fixes to components
5. Test responsive behavior across devices

## Files Created for Visual Evaluation
- `frontend/app/visual-test/page.tsx` - Comprehensive visual test page
- `browser_visual_evaluator.py` - Visual evaluation tool
- `fix_port_3000.py` - Port management script
- `FRONTEND_PORT_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md` - Previous analysis

## Expected Visual Test Results
The visual test page should display:
- Color palette chips (Primary, Secondary, Success, Warning, Error, Info)
- Typography hierarchy (H1-H6, body text, captions)
- Button variants (Contained, Outlined, Text)
- Form elements (TextField, Switch, Avatar)
- Progress indicators (Linear, Circular)
- Alert components (Success, Info, Warning, Error)
- Responsive grid layout
- Theme color swatches
- Spacing scale visualization
