# Problem Specification: Agentic LLM Core

## Overview
**Title:** Agentic LLM Core  
**Goal:** Local-first agent system using Qwen3-Omni, Pydantic-AI, LangChain, MCP tools  
**Created:** 2024-09-24  
**Status:** Draft

## Problem Statement

### Core Challenge
Build a sophisticated, local-first agentic LLM system that operates entirely offline while maintaining high performance, reproducibility, and security. The system must leverage cutting-edge technologies including Qwen3-Omni, Pydantic-AI, LangChain, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to create a deterministic, testable agent framework.

### Key Constraints
1. **Offline-by-default**: System must operate without internet connectivity
2. **Apple Silicon optimization**: Leverage M1/M2/M3 chip capabilities
3. **Spec-kit flow**: Follow specification-driven development methodology
4. **Deterministic tasks**: All operations must be reproducible and predictable

### Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. **Reproducible**: Every run must produce identical results given same inputs
2. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage with >85% coverage requirement
3. **No secret leakage**: Zero risk of credential or sensitive data exposure

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Qwen3-Omni**: Primary LLM for agent reasoning and task execution
- **Pydantic-AI**: Structured AI framework for type-safe agent operations
- **LangChain**: Agent orchestration and tool integration
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol for standardized tool interfaces

### Performance Requirements
- **Latency**: < 50ms response time for critical operations
- **Memory**: Efficient memory management for Apple Silicon
- **Throughput**: Support concurrent agent operations
- **Storage**: Local-first data persistence

### Security Requirements
- **Data isolation**: Complete separation of agent contexts
- **Credential management**: Secure handling of API keys and tokens
- **Audit trails**: Immutable logging of all operations
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environments
