## 🛠️ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Parallel Retrieval Engine
**Status**: Ready to implement

1. **Multi-Retrieval Strategy**:
   ```python
   # Parallel retrieval paths
   results = await asyncio.gather(
       sparse_search(query),           # BM25
       dense_search(query),            # Arctic embeddings
       graph_search(query),            # Weaviate graph
       expanded_search(query)          # Query expansion
   )
   ```

2. **Query Expansion Module**:
   - Generate multiple query perspectives
   - Use LLM to create semantic variants
   - Hybrid expansion (keywords + semantics)

3. **Graph Traversal**:
   - Leverage existing Weaviate integration
   - Entity relationship traversal
   - Multi-hop reasoning paths

### Phase 2: Cross-Encoder Reranking
**Status**: Research complete, ready to implement

1. **Arctic Reranker Integration**:
   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

   reranker = CrossEncoder("Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-reranker")
   scores = reranker.predict(query_passage_pairs)
   ```

2. **Hybrid Scoring**:
   - Combine retrieval scores with reranker scores
   - Confidence calibration
   - Diversity-aware selection

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Batch processing
   - GPU acceleration (Metal on Apple Silicon)
   - Caching strategies

### Phase 3: R1-Inspired Verification
**Status**: Ready to implement

1. **Multi-Perspective Validation**:
   - Cross-reference results from different retrieval paths
   - Consistency scoring
   - Confidence thresholds

2. **Progressive Refinement**:
   - Iterative improvement based on initial results
   - Feedback loop for query expansion
   - Adaptive retrieval depth

3. **Source Credibility Assessment**:
   - Document quality scoring
   - Source reliability metrics
   - Temporal relevance weighting

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Status**: Planned

1. **GraphRAG Integration**:
   - Knowledge graph construction from retrieved documents
   - Community detection for topic clustering
   - Hierarchical summarization

2. **Adaptive Learning**:
   - User feedback incorporation
   - Performance-based model switching
   - Query pattern analysis
