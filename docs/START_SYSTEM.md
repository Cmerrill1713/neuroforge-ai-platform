## 🧠 What Works Automatically (Behind the Scenes)

When you chat, the system automatically:

1. **Analyzes your message** (Intelligent Router)
2. **Selects optimal model** (Thompson Bandit + Model Registry)
3. **Executes with monitoring** (Orchestration Bridge)
4. **Learns from results** (Performance Learner)
5. **Improves over time** (Evolutionary Optimizer)

**You don't see any of this - it just works!**

All working silently in the background to give you the best responses.
