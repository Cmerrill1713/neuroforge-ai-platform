## 🐛 Bugs Found & Status

### Bug #1: Syntax Error in RAG Query Route ❌ → ✅
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Prevented frontend compilation  
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/api/rag/query/route.ts`  
**Cause:** Leftover mock code with extra closing brace  
**Fix:** Removed extra `}`  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  

**Before:**
```typescript
  }
}

}  // ← EXTRA CLOSING BRACE
```

**After:**
```typescript
  }
}
```

---

### Bug #2: Wrong Backend Port ❌ → ✅
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** RAG queries would fail silently  
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/api/rag/query/route.ts`  
**Cause:** Hardcoded `localhost:8004` instead of `8005`  
**Fix:** Updated to `localhost:8005`  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  

**Before:**
```typescript
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8004'
```

**After:**
```typescript
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8005'
```

---

### Bug #3: Bandit Stats Display Issue ⚠️
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Shows "NaN% reward" in UI  
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/EvolutionaryOptimizerPanel.tsx`  
**Cause:** Backend returns empty bandit stats, frontend tries to calculate percentages  
**Expected Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "genomes": [
    {"genome_id": "...", "pulls": 100, "mean_reward": 0.85}
  ],
  "total_pulls": 100,
  "best_genome": "genome_001"
}
```

**Actual Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "genomes": {},
  "current_backend": "unknown",
  "execution_history_count": 0
}
```

**Fix Needed:** Update frontend to handle empty bandit stats gracefully  
**Status:** ⚠️ **IDENTIFIED** (cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality)

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// In EvolutionaryOptimizerPanel.tsx
const reward = genome.mean_reward || 0
const rewardPercent = isNaN(reward) ? 0 : (reward * 100).toFixed(1)
```

## 💪 What Worked PERFECTLY

### 1. Error Handling ✅ A+
**Test:** Killed backend while frontend running  
**Result:** Frontend returned fallback data with clear error message  
```json
{
  "status": "offline",
  "error": "Backend unavailable"
}
```
**Analysis:** Excellent! User never sees a crash.

---

### 2. Docker Service Failures ✅ A
**Test:** Stopped Weaviate, Redis, PostgreSQL one by one  
**Results:**
- Weaviate down → RAG returns error, system stays up ✅
- Redis down → Cache disabled, system continues ✅
- PostgreSQL down → Health check reports it, system survives ✅

**Analysis:** Graceful degradation is excellent!

---

### 3. Concurrent Load ✅ A+
**Test:** 10 simultaneous requests  
**Result:** All completed successfully  
**Analysis:** No race conditions, no crashes, good throughput!

---

### 4. Large Inputs ✅ A
**Test:** 10,000 character query string  
**Result:** System processed without crash (slowly but safely)  
**Analysis:** No buffer overflow, proper memory handling!

---

### 5. Security ✅ A
**Test:** XSS and SQL injection attempts  
**Results:**
- `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` → Returned as escaped string ✅
- `test OR 1=1--` → Treated as literal text ✅

**Analysis:** Inputs are properly sanitized/escaped!

---

### 6. Invalid Inputs ✅ A
**Test:** Negative numbers, missing fields, malformed JSON  
**Result:** All handled gracefully with appropriate errors  
**Analysis:** Robust input validation!

---

### 7. Network Resilience ✅ A+
**Test:** Backend, database, cache all unavailable  
**Result:** Frontend stayed operational with degraded features  
**Analysis:** Excellent fault tolerance!
