# Restore specific documentation
tar -xzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz docs/evolutionary-system/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

# Restore specific script
tar -xzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz scripts/demos/run_evolution.py
```

#### Option 3: Git Restore (if needed)
```bash
# See what was deleted
git status

git restore FILENAME.md

# Restore everything
git restore .
```

## ✅ Verification

### Check Backups Exist:
```bash
ls -lh backups/
# Should show:
# - full_backup_*.tar.gz
# - YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_pre_cleanup/
```

### Verify Backup Content:
```bash
# List what's in compressed backup
tar -tzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz | head -20

# Count files in directory backup
find backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_pre_cleanup -type f | wc -l
```

### Test Restore (Dry Run):
```bash
# Test extraction without actually extracting
tar -tzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz > /tmp/backup_contents.txt
wc -l /tmp/backup_contents.txt
```

✅ Compressed archive (~10-50 MB)  
✅ Full directory backup  
✅ Excludes regenerable files  

### Recommended Strategy:
```
1. Git commits (version control)
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Organized project structure"
   
2. Periodic backups
   # Run daily or weekly:
   ./scripts/utilities/create_backup.sh
   
3. Cloud backup (optional)
   # Push to GitHub/GitLab
   git push
   
   # Or sync to cloud
   rclone sync . remote:backup
```

## 🛡️ Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I need that old doc"
```bash
# Check docs/archive first
ls docs/archive/ | grep KEYWORD

# If not there, check backup
tar -tzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz | grep KEYWORD
tar -xzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz path/to/file
```

### Scenario 2: "I deleted something by mistake"
```bash
# Git restore
git restore FILENAME

# Or extract from backup
tar -xzf backups/full_backup_*.tar.gz FILENAME
```

### Scenario 3: "I want the old structure back"
```bash
# Full restore
cd /tmp
tar -xzf /path/to/backup.tar.gz
# Review and copy what you need
```
