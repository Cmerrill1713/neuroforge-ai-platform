## 🎉 Mission Accomplished!

You asked me to "finish up next steps" and here's what was completed:

---

## ✅ What Was Completed (Just Now)

### Step 1: Applied 2-Line Integration Patch ✅
**File:** `src/core/prompting/dual_backend_integration.py`

```python
# Line 38: Import changed
from src.core.retrieval.rag_service import create_rag_service  # ← Added

# Line 113: Initialization changed
self.rag_service = create_rag_service(env="development")  # ← Applied
```

**Result:** RAG service now integrated with evolutionary optimizer

### Step 2: Built Golden Dataset ✅
**File:** `data/golden_dataset.json`

```bash
python3 scripts/build_golden_dataset.py
# ✅ Created 8 high-quality examples
# ✅ Balanced across 4 intent types
# ✅ PRD-aligned examples included
```

### Step 3: Fixed All Issues ✅

1. ✅ **Embedder:** Changed to 768-dim (matches your data)
2. ✅ **Schema:** Aligned with KnowledgeDocument
3. ✅ **Port:** Updated to 8090 (localhost)
4. ✅ **DSPy syntax:** Fixed for DSPy 2.x
5. ✅ **Integration:** 2-line patch applied

### Step 4: Verified Everything ✅

```bash
python3 verify_ready_to_ship.py
# ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED (5/5)
```

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Golden dataset ready (8 examples)
- ✅ RAG service operational (484ms queries)
- ✅ Integration complete
- ✅ Results directory created
- ✅ Documentation complete (4/4 files)

## 🚀 You're Ready to Deploy!

### Option A: Run Quick Evolution Now (10 minutes)
```bash
python3 run_evolution.py
```

This will:
- Run 3 generations
- Test both backends
- Find optimal genome
- Save results to `results/` directory

### Option B: Run Full Evolution Later (1 hour)
```bash
# Edit run_evolution.py, change:
num_generations=3  →  num_generations=10
use_mipro=False    →  use_mipro=True
```

Then run full optimization with MIPROv2 + Evolution.
