# Root Directory Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 **Cleanup Completed**

The root directory has been organized and cleaned up. All experimental files have been moved to appropriate subdirectories.

## 📁 **New Organization**

## ✅ **What Was Moved**

### **To experiments/testing/**
- All `qwen_*.py` test scripts
- All `test_*.py` scripts
- Experiment result markdown files
- Coverage reports
- Requirements files

### **To experiments/mlx/**
- MLX conversion scripts
- MLX output directories

### **To experiments/finetuning/**
- Fine-tuning setup scripts
- Smaller model testing scripts

### **To src/core/**
- `integration_test.py` (moved to proper location)

### **To examples/**
- `run_task.py` (moved to examples)

## 🎯 **Benefits of Cleanup**

1. **Clean Root**: Easy to navigate and understand project structure
2. **Organized Experiments**: All experimental work is properly categorized
3. **Clear Separation**: Core code vs. experimental code is clearly separated
4. **Maintainable**: Future development is easier to organize
5. **Professional**: Project looks organized and professional

## 🚀 **Ready for Development**

The root directory is now clean and ready for:
- Core development work
- Easy navigation
- Professional presentation
- Future organization

All experimental work is preserved in the `experiments/` directory for future reference and continued development.
