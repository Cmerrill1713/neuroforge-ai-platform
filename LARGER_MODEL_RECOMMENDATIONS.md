# üöÄ **Larger Model Recommendations: Performance Analysis & Solutions**

## üìä **Performance Issues Identified**

Based on our MCP functional test results, we've identified several critical performance bottlenecks that indicate we need larger, more capable models:

### **Current Model Performance Problems:**

1. **Response Time Inconsistency**:
   - `llama3.1:8b`: 1.62s (too slow for real-time)
   - `qwen2.5:7b`: 0.35s (acceptable but limited capability)
   - `mistral:7b`: 1.07s (moderate, inconsistent)

2. **Reasoning Quality Issues**:
   - **Verification Score**: 0.70/1.0 (70% - needs improvement)
   - **Confidence Levels**: Inconsistent (0.8-1.0 range)
   - **Analysis Depth**: Shallow, repetitive responses
   - **Complex Task Handling**: Struggling with multi-step reasoning

3. **System Integration Challenges**:
   - **Parallel Reasoning**: 54+ seconds for complex analysis
   - **Self-Supervised Learning**: Limited pattern recognition
   - **MCP Tool Integration**: Inconsistent tool usage
   - **Knowledge Base Queries**: Suboptimal retrieval and synthesis
