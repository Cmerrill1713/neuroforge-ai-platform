- DSPy MIPROv2 for prompt optimization
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with real-time capabilities

CURRENT CAPABILITIES:
- Chat with intelligent agent selection
- Knowledge base search and retrieval using vector embeddings
- System metrics and performance monitoring
- Model status checking and switching
- Real-time streaming responses
- Parallel reasoning for complex tasks

- Prompt optimization using DSPy

IMPORTANT: DO NOT BUILD NEW SYSTEMS - ENHANCE EXISTING ONES
HRM should work alongside other models, not replace them.

3. Identify hidden opportunities
4. Propose innovative solutions
5. Think outside the box

Focus on:
- Creative enhancements to existing components
- Innovative approaches to current problems
- Unconventional solutions that build on existing systems
- Lateral thinking for system improvements

Format your response as:

**HERETICAL APPROACHES**: [Unconventional solutions]
