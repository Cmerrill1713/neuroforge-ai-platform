SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
- Local-first AI agent system with multiple LLM models (Ollama)
- Real-time chat and tool execution capabilities
- Apple Silicon optimized (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Privacy-focused, runs entirely locally
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
- Parallel reasoning engine
- Knowledge base integration

REQUIREMENTS:
- Modern, responsive UI (desktop + mobile)
- Real-time chat interface with streaming responses
- Tool execution visualization and monitoring
- Model performance metrics and switching
- Apple Silicon optimization
- Dark/light theme support
- Fast, smooth user experience
