3. **FIND** gaps or limitations
4. **EVALUATE** the current architecture
5. **RECOGNIZE** what's working well

Focus on your expertise area:
- System Architect: Overall architecture and design patterns
- Frontend Specialist: UI/UX and user experience
- Performance Analyst: Performance and optimization
- Integration Expert: Component integration and connectivity
- Product Strategist: User needs and feature gaps

Format your response as:
