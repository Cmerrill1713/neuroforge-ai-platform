## 🤖 **Vision Model Analysis Results**

Our LLaVA 7B model identified key issues and provided actionable recommendations:

### **Issues Identified:**
1. **Dated Design**: Basic layout looked like early 2000s
2. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: All panels had equal weight, no focus

6. **Poor Typography**: Basic fonts, no visual interest
7. **Bland Colors**: Gray/white scheme is uninspiring

### **Recommendations Implemented:**
1. **Card-based Layout**: Floating cards with shadows
2. **Better Typography**: Modern font stack, better hierarchy
3. **Color System**: Vibrant, accessible color palette
4. **Responsive Grid**: Mobile-first responsive design
5. **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects, smooth transitions
6. **Visual Branding**: Custom icons, illustrations, personality
7. **Better Spacing**: More breathing room, better proportions
